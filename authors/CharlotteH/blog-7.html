                                <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 10%;">

                                    <p>Effectively managing the number of people working on a project can be difficult, especially when managing a large project that will require not only a long amount of time to complete but a large number of individuals to complete. However, not all of these individuals will be needed all the time or even all at the same time. In many organizations and companies, employees will work on several projects at once and project managers are expected to know how to manage their employee resources effectively for each project. Learning how to manage the needed individuals for a project over the life of the project is an important part of managing resources as a project manager.</p>

                                    <p>A staffing management plan is a way to visually see what parts of the project will need certain kinds of employees at different stages of the project. It will help managers to determine when employees will be added and taken off of the project while maintaining the timeline commitment of the project. For example: if a project is going to take six months but technical writers will only be needed for the last month of the project it does not make sense to have a technical writer on the team for the first five months of the project as they will not be needed during that time frame. During the first five months of the project, the technical writer could be working on another project, which would be a more efficient use of their time and the resources they provide for projects.</p>

                                    <p>Often projects are broken into not only smaller time tables with deliverables but each of the smaller project parts are further broken into segments that can each be assigned to a team of people. This allows for project managers to identify and assign only the needed resources to each of these project segments and increases the likelihood of each project deliverable being completed on time as there have been efficient resources assigned to the project for that time period.</p>

                                    <p>When deciding on what employee resources are needed for a project it is important to consider where in the project you are and how long the project will need that resource. A project manager will be needed throughout the project but, as exampled above, a technical writer will not be needed until the project is towards completion. By breaking down the project into partitions of time, like a month, it allows you as the project manager to not only map out the project movement as time progresses but to also better identify what types of employee resources are going to be needed. One way to see this visually is with a resource histogram such as the image below from Information Technology Project management. </p>

                                    <figure>
                                        <img src="../../images/thumbnail_IMG_0767.jpg" alt="Resource Histogram">
                                        <figcaption>Resource Histogram</figcaption>
                                    </figure>

                                    <p>Above we can see that a project manager will always be needed on a project no matter where in the development the project is. We can also see the number of people that are estimated to be needed each month of the project as it progresses over time. By breaking down the different kinds of employee resources that are going to be needed during a specific time period of the project it allows the project manager to be able to take resources when needed and then release resources back to other projects and other project managers. </p>

                                    <p>We can see that during the first two months of the project there is only one programmer assigned to the project because most of the work is being done by the business analysts where as in March there are three more programmers added to the project that will stay on for two additional months when they are released back to other projects.</p>

                                    <p>This kind of visualization of resources allows for the project manager to more accurately represent the resources that they are going to need for different parts of the project. This will also allow them to more accurately identify time periods when external resources may need to be procured for a project and a better time period to base the use of external resources on.</p>

                                    <p>As most individuals know, it can take time to evaluate and hire individuals that are needed for work. A staffing management plan will allow for project managers to begin this process at an appropriate time during the course of the project. For example: a year-long project needs three business analysts for the first three months but after the three months have passed the project will only need one business analyst to continue on. If your company only has two analysts it will still need to hire a third analyst, most likely by contract, to be on the project for the first three months before they are released from the project. </p>

                                    <p>A staffing management plan can also help to deal with issues such as medical/emergency based leaves, maternity/paternity leave, and other sudden departures from companies. If a project manager knows beforehand that an employee can work for a couple of months on a project before they will be out for six week for a surgery or for six months on maternity leave, the project manager can plan more appropriately for who will take over that employee's duties on the project when the employee goes on leave.</p>

                                    <p>During a time when an employee may have a serious emergency that forces them to take unexpected but necessary time off of work, the staffing management plan allows for the project manager to quickly identify what the role of that person was in the project and to appropriately find a new employee to take the place of the previous employee.</p>

                                    <p>As we have exemplified in the blog, staffing management plans provide a very quick and intuitive way to determine what employee resources are needed at different stages of the project, allowing the project manager to more accurately assess their needs and have a better idea of when they will need to take resources from their company and when they can be released back to other projects.</p>
