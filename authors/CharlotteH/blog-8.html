                                    <p>Meetings are a routine of business and are often direct sources of information for projects. They help to 
                                    reduce confusion about projects and project goals and to create a more effective environment to work within. 
                                    Meetings are a form of communication just like email, phone calls, and video conferences. Just like email, 
                                    phone calls, and voicemails, they need to have a defined purpose for their use to be justifiable. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>One of the most important parts about effective communication in meetings is determining if a meeting 
                                    is actually an appropriate way to disseminate the information that needs to be conveyed. Scheduling a meeting 
                                    to give an update about a company picnic that has been canceled or that the color scheme used in a website is 
                                    slightly different than what it needs to be is not an effective use of communication nor is it an effective 
                                    use of time for everyone called into a meeting. The news of a company picnic being canceled is most
                                     effectively communicated over email while changing a color scheme is a simple call or email to the graphic 
                                     designers handling that aspect of a website. Discussing new company guidelines that involve how project life 
                                     cycles are going to be developed is a topic that should be discussed in a meeting.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>If you choose to hold a meeting, make sure to know what the topic of the meeting is and the information
                                     that is being discussed. Documents like agendas that highlight important topics that are being covered in the
                                      meeting and can be given out ahead of time to give all of the attendees an idea of what the meeting is for
                                       and what will be discussed. Agendas also help to keep meetings organized and on topic. Project managers
                                        should also make sure to indicate what additional documents or information that everyone in the meeting
                                         needs to be familiar with in order for the meeting to maintain its effectiveness in delivering the
                                          topic(s) of the meeting. For example: in a budget review meeting, the participants should be at least
                                           somewhat familiar with how the budget is formatted and any parts that they are responsible for knowing 
                                           or keeping track of.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Determining who will attend a meeting will depend on the purpose of the meeting and impact how the
                                     meeting will operate. If it is a meeting with a team that has worked together for a longer period of time it 
                                     does not make sense for things like name tags to be provided as everyone will already know each other. If it 
                                     is an annual meeting and many of the participants work at different locations that the company has then they 
                                     will most likely need name tags as no one will know every person there. Meetings that are for project reviews
                                      will have different team members attending then a meeting that is about a serious update to a project’s 
                                      requirements. Always think about who should attend a meeting and why they need to attend. This will help 
                                      to reduce any attendance that is not needed.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Handouts are an excellent way to help disseminate information that is being given out during a meeting
                                     that cannot be shown to the attendees prior to the meeting. Ensuring that the information that is given is 
                                     a quick summary of the topics being discussed is a way to help people keep along with the meeting and to 
                                     help them remember important information after the meeting.
                                    </p> 

                                    <p>Visuals can be used as a way to show information that is based on data. This is a common occurrence
                                     in monetary-based meetings and can be applied to more than just money and basic data. It can be used to 
                                     demonstrate timelines of the project, how resources are going to be spread across the project’s life span, 
                                     or even how tasks for the current part of the project are going to be divided up.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>It is easy for meetings to run over the allotted time frame that the project manager determined was
                                     needed. It is important to remember that participants have other things that they need to get done in their 
                                     work day just like you do. This may mean that they need to have time for coding on a project or that they 
                                     need to attend another meeting right after the one they are currently attending. It is always good practice 
                                     to end meetings on time or even slightly beforehand. This will ensure that not only does the meeting not go 
                                     over the time limit but will also help to prevent the meeting from getting too far off topic as the topics 
                                     will need to be covered in the allotted time. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>While some kinds of meetings lend themselves more to a presentation style of discussion, most project 
                                    meetings will involve the participation of all the attendees. Make sure to encourage feedback with the 
                                    participants and keep up the conversation of the meeting. Be careful though, that the  feedback and 
                                    discussions are not getting too far away from the topics at hand and to note any feedback that seems 
                                    concerning or any issues/ideas that should be looked into. These can be used to help better the project as 
                                    a whole and to improve communication between the team members on the project.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The project manager's goal of holding a meeting is to disseminate information that needs to be
                                     dispersed but to not control the conversation that results from the information. By controlling the 
                                     conversation, you inhibit the free thought that encourages ideas that may be more beneficial to the 
                                     project than the current plans that are in place. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>To summarize, meetings are only appropriate if that is the best way to disseminate information to
                                     individuals as a project manager. If the information can be sent just as easily by email with no confusion 
                                     then send the email and don’t call the meeting. Save that time! Use the following tips to make the most of 
                                     your meeting.
