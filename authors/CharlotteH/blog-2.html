                                        Scope management is an important component of project and project management. While the scope of a project may only seem important because it provides a requirement basis to the project, the scope is actually what defines the project and sets the pace of how the project will proceed. The scope also acts as a sort of contract for the stakeholders to agree to the terms of the project and have an idea what the project will require from the team working on it along with setting their expectations for the project outcome. Scope creep is a very real threat to the success of a project.                                    <p>
                                        One part of the plan that is very important for stakeholders to know about and understand is the scope of the project. Because scope creep is a common occurrence as stakeholders talk through the requirements, needs, and wants of the project being developed, it is important for the final requirements of the project to be explicitly stated at the beginning of the plan so that stakeholders have an immediate understanding of the project’s scope. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Scope creep is defined as an increase in the requirements of a project during the duration of the project. These increases can be caused by additional requirements that were not identified initially, changes for the stakeholder, or initial requirements that were not clear in their definition. This has a multiplying effect on the project as for each new requirement there will be new deliverables, reports, and other things. While scope creep may not seem like a large issue with one new requirement, but it is very possible that with one new requirement during part of the project will come three new requirements during a later part of the project. These increases also are more likely to cause adverse effects on a project.
                                    </p>

                                        The effect of scope creep on a project is often difficult to judge when the creep first begins. Therefore, it can be difficult to ascertain if the project is going to be affected or how it going to affected. One of the main components of the project that is affected by scope creep is the time it takes to complete the project. Adding requirements usually means that there must be more work to be done on the project than was originally planned and budgeted. This also means that there may need to be a change in who is working on what aspect of the project in an effort to maintain balanced attention to the original requirements and to the new requirement(s).                                     </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The need to add additional requirements to the scope of a project after the scope has already been established also indicates that there was a lack of communication with the stakeholders about the needs and wants that the project should address. If this is a main cause behind the scope creep, then it is also possible that the original requirements identified when planning the scope are not accurate to the true nature of the project. This could mean that there are requirements in the scope that are either irrelevant, inaccurate, or unclear in their intent. If this is found to be the case, then the project must be reassessed to determine if the requirements are still valid or if they need to be changed. While this is not a good position for any project to be in, if the project is much further along in development, it could mean that the project is much more likely to be unsuccessful.                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As stated in the introductory paragraph, scope management is not only the definition of the project requirements but also involves the process of how the requirements are identified, managed, and validated as well as any associated documentation that may be needed. One of the best ways to prevent scope creep is with planning scope management. While this may seem like an oxymoron, planning for scope management is way to define how the scope of a project is addressed. This plan is intended to be used throughout the project as a part of the project’s life cycle.                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the big areas that planning for scope management addresses is changes and additions to the requirements of the project. By planning how to handle any changes or additions, it creates an opportunity for preventing the scope of the project from experiencing scope creep. This plan allows for requests of new requirements to be assessed before they are approved to be added to a project scope. By having this in the project management plan, it is also shared with all of the stakeholders. This in turn helps to communicate to the stakeholders how the process of changing or adding requirements to the project will progress and that the project manager has the right to decide that a suggested requirement or change to a requirement cannot be preformed during the project. This also opens up the avenue that after the project is completed, a second complementary project can begin to address the changes or additional requirements.                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another area of the scope management that is addressed with planning scope management is how deliverables for the project will be accepted and how the Work Breakdown Structure will be dealt with throughout the project. While there will be a variety of deliverables that will be created throughout the life cycle of the project, creating a standard of acceptance for these deliverables also helps to set expectations of what deliverables are needed for each of the project requirements. This allows for the individuals writing or creating the deliverable to better manage their time and efforts when completing the deliverable as well as setting the standard of acceptance of the deliverable. Likewise, with the WBS, it is highly likely, and highly expected, that the WBS will change over the course of project, at times depending on what requirements are currently in the process of being completed. Having a set of guidelines in the planning of scope management allows for the necessary changes to be made in the WBS. These guidelines are especially important when there are differing opinions as to how the WBS should be changed and why.             

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Scope creep is a very real threat to a project and can often result in the failure of a project if the scope is continually expanded or changed. By planning how the scope is managed throughout the project’s life cycle and setting standards to address how changes in requirements, deliverables, and the WBS, it is easily possible to ensure that the scope of the project will not be the cause of failure.
