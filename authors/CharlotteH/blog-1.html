                                        Managing stakeholder expectations is a big part of managing a project as a project manager. One way to clearly ensure that the terms of the project are known to everyone involved in the project is for the project manager to write a Project Management Plan. This plan covers an array of topics that can provide details and insight for the stakeholders as the project progresses.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        One part of the plan that is very important for stakeholders to know about and understand is the scope of the project. Because scope creep is a common occurrence as stakeholders talk through the requirements, needs, and wants of the project being developed, it is important for the final requirements of the project to be explicitly stated at the beginning of the plan so that stakeholders have an immediate understanding of the project’s scope. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The budget of a project is easily one of the most important aspects of a project for stakeholders. As with most organizations or entities, stakeholders are aware of what can be spent on a project and that they need to work within this budget as much as possible as there would be no guarantee that they could secure more funding if the project exceeds the budgeted amount, especially if it is by a large sum. Transparency of the budget also allows for stakeholders to be able to more effectively determine what the scope of the project should be along with establishing a reasonable schedule.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The schedule established in the plan allows for stakeholders follow along the general aspects of the project as it develops. This in turn allows them to voice any changes or concerns that they may have before the project reaches or surpasses the part of the project where those concerns lay. The schedule also allows the stakeholders to determine if the project is staying on track with the schedule, if it is ahead of schedule, or if it is behind the schedule. This is especially important if the project is behind schedule as it will allow the stakeholders to be an active part of determining if the cause behind the delay is an aspect of the project that needs to be addressed because it is more complex than originally thought or if there have been other issues causing the delay. 
                                    </p>

                                        Stakeholder engagement is very important to the success of a project and part of the project managers roles is to facilitate this engagement and disseminate necessary information about the project to the stakeholders. Defining the terms of the stakeholder’s engagement in the Project Management Plan also allows the stakeholder to set forth their expectations of how involved they need and want to be throughout the project. This allows the project manager to more accurately gauge how often stakeholders want to be notified of project progress as well as what information needs to be passed along to the stakeholders. This passing of information is especially important as it will ensure that the project is proceeding in the correct way with what the stakeholder is wanting the outcome of the project to be.
                                    </p>

                                        Identifying the project life cycle system being used to the stakeholders can be very beneficial to engaging them in the project on a long-term basis and ensuring that the stakeholders understand how the progress of the project will proceed. Since there are so many different approaches to designing and building a project, such as agile, waterfall, RAD, etc., having the project life cycle identified along with a description of how the chosen life cycle works will allow the project manager to better plan how to engage the stakeholders with the project as it progresses and allow the stakeholders to have a better understanding of how the project will progress until it reaches its final outcome. This will also be beneficial for understanding the schedule that is part of the Project Management Plan as well because that schedule will be based in part on the life cycle that is chosen for the project.
                                    </p>

                                        One very important area that should be addressed is procurement management. While it is not always important for stakeholders to know what external resources, products, or services, some companies/organizations will not work or want the involvement of some specific products, services, or external vendors due to working constraints that stakeholder’s company has implemented internally. This should not be an occurrence that happens often, nor will most stakeholders have any preference for what external products or services that are used during the project. However, in the event that a stakeholder does request the information, it is important that the procurement information be detailed in the Project Management Plan. This will allow you as the project manager to easily communicate the information with the stakeholders and to change any of the products or services that are a problem for the stakeholder.

                                        While there are many different documents that are included in the Project Management Plan, stakeholders will be very interested in the test and evaluation documents. These documents will help the stakeholders determine if the project stage being tested is functional for their needs. If it is not then the stakeholders can point out any issues that have occurred from these documents with the hope that they can be addressed within the schedule of the project. These documents are also a way to record any testing that is done by the stakeholders themselves to allow them to review any progress that was made since the last testing that they participated in or reviewed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are several elements and many kinds of documents that make up a Project Management Plan. As a project manager it is your responsibility to know how to identify which areas of the plan will benefit the stakeholders the most along with ensuring that the content of the areas mentioned above are as accurate as possible. This will ensure that the project will not only be much more likely to have a positive outcome but also ensure that the stakeholders are empowered throughout the process of the project.
