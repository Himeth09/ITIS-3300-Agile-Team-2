                                        While the schedule of a project may not seem important beyond a few important dates that must be meet, it goes a far bit beyond this and a schedule’s creation involves many factors that must be taken into account. Schedules for projects include a variety of activities and tasks that need to be completed along with different deliverables that are needed for each iteration of the project’s life cycle along with estimated time frames for how long each of these will take. This helps project managers determine how long the project will take until it is completed and the amount of time that tasks will need to be completed. Therefore, it is important to have a defined way to manage the creation and continuation of a project’s schedule.

                                        In chapter 6 of Information Technology Project Management by Kathy Schwalbe, it states that project schedule management is a process that is used to “ensure the timely completion of a project.” This is done through a variety of ways, mainly by establishing policies and criteria for how the schedule will be treated along with specifying what activities will happen, what they involve, and when they will occur. This information allows the project manager to more accurately determine who needs to be assigned to what task. In order to determine who will get what task on a schedule, project managers must take into account the individuals working on the project and their personal work ways as well as the team, or parts of the team, and how they will work together as a whole. This team cohesion also must account for the cultural differences that can exist between team members or, on larger teams, whole parts of a team.
