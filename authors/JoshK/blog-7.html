<p> In this blog post we are going to talk about some keys to having good communication. Project managers spend a lot of their time communicating with their teams and people and having to find their motivations and understand the people they are working with. “Project managers say they spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicating”- (Schwalbe, 428). All of this communication you need to be well versed and know how to communicate and deal with people properly. There are several different ways to approach this and learn this that we will discuss here. These approaches include formal and informal forms of communications, individual communication vs group communication, providing information in timely manners and much more. This is a vital part of being a project manager which is knowing how to communicate. </p>

                            <p> The first part of this is focusing on the communication needs of your teams. In the text book it brings up a great quote which is “you cannot take nine women and produce a baby in one month”- (Schwalbe, 428). This quote is saying that if you need to finish a project faster you can not just add on people to your project in order to complete it quicker. You need to be able to communicate to your team about needing to speed up the process and figure out what they need in order to get the job done quicker. If you try to add people onto the project its going to take the same amount of time as they are doing the same job on a project. Also the person will need time to learn what they are doing and to be able to do it effectively. Also with these people that would come on you would have to take time to learn about them and how it is best to communicate with them as that takes lots of time. You need to figure out if they are introverted or extroverted or if they are intuitive. This is because some of these personalities can conflict with others like for example introverts and extroverts will be a conflict on how they communicate and can lead to communication issues in a group. Some of the people may require a very detailed instructions on what they need to do and others may just need a general idea to get what they need. </p>

                            <p> Next part we are going to discuss is providing several forms of communication. From the text it says “the receiver of information rarely interprets it exactly as the sender intended”- Schwalbe (429). You want the receiver who is receiving the information to do the work correctly and have the correct information exactly. So it is very important to have different forms of communication that are detailed for their understanding. This is such as having it written, in videos, visuals or other ways. This is important because it decreases the chances by a lot of having the details of what is needed to be done by a lot. It is allowing for them to have several sources to refer to and to be able to understand it. This will also cater to a lot of different personalities that people have and their desired ways of understanding and learning what they need to do. Also instead of just assuming that they understand from all of the different sources you have you also need to reach out to them and make sure they understand and let them report back to you the project manager. If they do not then you can figure out other ways to cater and make sure this gets across as clearly and efficiently as possible to get the ball rolling on the project. It is important to make sure that all messages and everything is clear and being understood very well. A quote I found in the textbook really explains this well which is “You cannot over communicate!”- Schwalbe (429). This is really important to know because you cannot ever over communicate with your team. You always need to make sure they are on track and understand what needs to be done. This is incredibly important for them to know exactly what is going on so in the final you get exactly what you were asking for from them. </p>

                            <p> The next section of discussion is formal and informal methods of communication. Knowing when to use formal and informal methods is very important and depends on the team members you are working with. The team you are working with will generally decide what they prefer. Formal communication tends to lean more into doing reports and submitting those to the manager and informal leans more to having 2 way conversations about the project and just casually talking about the projects. Lots of people don't want to have to sit and read reports about the project and would rather have these 2 way conversations. This also leads to a great relationship with your team members as you get to know them better when having these conversations with them. These typically build stronger relationships between everyone on the project and the managers and even the stakeholders in the project. </p>

                            <p> Communicating with team members is incredibly important and this was some key ways to make sure communication was as good as possible. Being a project manager and spending a lot of time communicating is a part of the everyday job so its key to know ways to be a better communicator. You want your projects to go as smoothly as possible and not want a mess up because of poor communication on something that could have been avoided. From informal to formal discussions on which is best and getting to know your team members and how they need to be talked to and given instructions so they know how to receive information clearly. This should all help communication go a lot smoother. It is incredibly important to also make sure that all of this is communicated and delivered in a timely and efficient fashion so they can get ahead on what needs to be done and not waste time on trying to figure out what they need to do. </p>
