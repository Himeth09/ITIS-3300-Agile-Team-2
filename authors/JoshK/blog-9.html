<p> In this blog post we are going to be discussing using software to assist in project procurement. First off you may ask what is project procurement? Project procurement is when you need vendors in order to complete a project whether that is to rent something from them or such. Basically they get services from this vendor to help them achieve their goal in their project that they are working towards. This is great to help using products that you need in order to complete your project that you are working towards. So we will be discussing how using vendors to help you be successful. As well we will be discussing how to use software to assist in project procurement. There are many different softwares that will help and assist in this and we will be discussing each one. These can be from spreadsheets to proposals and contracts. It can be software to help create any of these. We will be going over these softwares that help assist with these needs for the project. </p>

                            <p> There are many different types of softwares that are used to help with project procurement. These functions are now performed online and making it easier for project managers to help do theses task online and not do them on paper. The first one we are going to discuss is electronic resource planning. ERP is basically a place to place orders or complete orders on a system online. Then we have E-sourcing which is just finding new vendors. Then we have E-market sites which is online buying and receiving orders online for different products that you may need for your projects or for your team. Lots of companies and project managers use these different online functions so they can help their team and do things online without doing them on paper such as buying things or online softwares. Or in the textbook it refers to “most business travelers use the web to purchase airline tickets and to reserve rental cars and hotel rooms for business trips.” (Schwalbe, Pg.530). This is a great example of using online functions so you are able to book plane tickets or hotel rooms for your team or yourself so you are able to make a travel in order to help fill a requirement for a project or if you need to meet with someone. </p>

                            <p> Many of these softwares that are used can be literally anything online that can help with your team and your project. There are also some more different types of softwares you can also use that can help with your projects. These are E-purchasing which is just being able to order things online from catalogs and without having to get them in person. Also E-invoicing so you are allowed to send invoices to customers or such electronically and not have to send a paper copy as this is a lot easier faster and saves time and supplies. This is also typically easier for the customer as we want it to be as convenient for them as possible as well so they don't have to wait for it they can get it instantly online and not have to hold onto it. There is also Accounts payable invoice automation. This is typically just the accounts payable that is automatic and not have to be manually approved throughout and it can be done fast quick and easy without having to have someone put all of this information in by hand. This allows for it to be easier on your team to get things done easier and quicker throughout the day. Next we also have catalog management capabilities. Catalog management capabilities is basically the easiness of people able to upload and update catalog for your customers viewability and ease of navigation and purchase. You want the customers to be able to easily navigate this catalog while it is also very easy to update and take things in and out of the catalog at ease with no big hassle. Being able to search and update the catalog without having it be a hassle is nice. </p>

                            <p> As you can see there are many different types of functionalities that you can look for when looking for a software to use for your company. There are hundreds of tools to look for and finding the perfect software can be quite difficult. You have to keep trial and erroring different ones in order to find the one with all of the functionalities that you and your company needs. These softwares typically do come at a fee but after investing in them and finding the best one for you and your company it is all well worth it. It will make things way easier for you and your company and employees. They will be happy with the software and can save you tons of time by doing this. After considering all of your options you can get a trial for a software or purchase it for a certain amount of time to find the functionalities and see exactly what you need. These softwares are necessary to keep your day to day going and being easy to run and navigate. You want the softwares you use easy to navigate for your employees but also when it comes to catalogs and invoices and such you want it to be easy on your customers as well. You want them to be happy with what you choose to use so they have no difficulties with it on their end because it can affect them as well. We want all of our work to be as easy on our customers as possible and also as easy on our employees as possible. To start I would find the functionalities that you need in your software then find softwares with those minimums of functionalities and test run those softwares. After find the best one that works for you your team and your customers and invest strictly into that one and have all of your employees learn that software and use that on a day to day basis. </p>
