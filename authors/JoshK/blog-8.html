<P> In this blog post we are going to be discussing about planning risk responses. There are many ways to calculate risk but when risk happens we have to know how to respond to them and make them reduced risk or even positive risk. There are some basic strategies for negative risk and as well as positive risk in which we will be discussing here. You as the project manager really want to reduce any negative risk that can occur but you also really want to help any positive risk you have and really enhance what you have going on. </p>

                            <p> First we are going to start off with some negative risk strategies and the first one we are going to discuss is risk avoidance. Risk avoidance is very important because any negative risk that can be avoided is going to be preferable even though all of them can not be eliminated. The textbook uses a great example of this with “a project team may decide to continue using a specific piece of hardware or software on a project because the team knows it works. Other products that could be used on the project may be available, but if the project team doesn't know how to use them, they could cause significant risk” (Schwalbe, Pg.491). This is a great example because a team can have a software that they know how to use and will work they are eliminating a risk by using that software instead of something new or something they are unfamiliar with. This greatly reduces the risk of anything going wrong with this project. It does not completely avoid risk as you can never completely eliminate risk but it does greatly reduce the risk here by doing this. If you are on a project and your team knows how to use VIM as a text editor and you decide to use a different editor chances are things could go wrong as they aren't as familiar with that software as they are with VIM. This could lead to technical issues and cause things to take longer than they should. </p>

                            <p>Another negative risk strategy we are going to discuss is risk acceptance. This is when you are accepting the risk and accepting that there are going to be some consequences if this risk does occur in your project. For this type of risk you are going to want to know what the risk is and how much it will affect your project. Typically you will need to have a backup or emergency plan to switch to just in case this risk does occur. The next negative risk strategy is going to be risk mitigation. Risk mitigation is when you are trying to decrease or reduce the affect this risk will have on the project if it does occur. This one goes very much hand and hand with risk avoidance and are very similar. Risk mitigation you basically want to try and make sure that the risk it reduced as much as possible just like avoidance when you want to avoid running into this issue. This includes just using software and hardwares that you are using in the project that you know is going to work for you and your team. Use strategies and things that you know are not going to run into issues and if you do that your team knows the product well enough that they can fix the issues that they run into. Lastly in the negative risk strategies is going to be risk escalation. Risk escalation is when a risk has happened and you need to bring it up to a higher manager or such that can help you manage this risk. This does not have to be a higher manager but it can just be anybody that is outside of this project and can give you a outside look going in on this risk and how to handle it. This is typically brought to higher management for them to help out on. Risk escalation is also a part of both negative and positive risk strategies. </p>

                            <p> Now moving on to some responses for positive risk that can happen. Firstly we are going to go over Risk exploitation. Risk exploitation is when there is a positive risk at hand and you are doing everything you can to make sure this risk occurs. An example of this is when you are dealing with a customer and you want to make them happy because they are a valued customer. You can cut them a deal and make them a happy customer which could lead to more business for you from this customer. This can be especially important if this is a big customer like a business or such that could lead you to more business in the future and have you more business in the future. This is taking a risk and cutting them a deal or potentially taking a loss on something for a more positive outcome in the future. Another positive risk is risk acceptance. This is when a risk that no work is going towards the positive risk because it is expected to happen. You just kind of let it go and let it come to you. </p>

                            <p> These are some basic strategies that can be used to help you and your team respond to positive and negative risk that can occur during projects and help you as a manger to know how to respond. There are way more strategies that can be used but these are some very basic ones to help get started. Using each of these will help you manage risk better and help your minimize your negative risk while also maximizing your positive risk. There are some examples here that will help and you can kind of see how they happen. Also some of these strategies will include making some other risk as it is never possible to completely get rid of risk. In every decision you make there will be some risk involved whether that is positive or negative. These are just strategies that will help minimize any bad risk you have while also maximizing your positive risk. </p>
