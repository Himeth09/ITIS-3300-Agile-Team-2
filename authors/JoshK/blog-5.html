<p> In this post we are going to be going over the topic of Project Quality Management. The first question you may ask is what is project quality management? Project quality management is basically taking each activity going on inside of a project and making sure it goes well and making sure no problems occur. As a project manager you are making sure a project can go as smoothly as possible and with little errors to finish on time. This is a big step in that and planning any situations that could possibly occur. You are also planning to prepare any actions you must take as the manager to make sure that situation is able to get passed by with your team. As the manager you have to be ready for all of these situations to happen and be ready to help get your team past these situations. You also have to be ready to communicate well when these situations do occur so your team knows how to solve them. </p>

                            <p> Project quality can also depend on the customers' needs and on what they need for their final product. You also need to have great communication with the customer so you know exactly what they want in their product. The quality of the project can depend on communication with the customer so you need to make sure that communication is there so there are no misunderstandings. Explain in the text book by Schwalbe it says “Even if the development of hardware, software, and networking technology would stand still for a while, customers often have difficulty explaining exactly what they want in an IT project.” (Schwalbe Page 332). This is explaining that even if you stop the project for a little, customers will always struggle with getting their ideas of what they want across so you have to be willing to help and have great communication with your customer. So a big portion here is making sure there is great communication. </p>

                            <p> There are multiple project scopes that relate to project quality management. The first one is going to be the functionality and features of the product. “It is important to clarify what functions and features the system must perform, and what functions and features are optional.” (Schwalbe Page 333). Here is a great quote from the text book that is explaining how function and feature and having clear communication with the customer is important. There can be functions and features that are must haves for them and their product and there are optional functions and features. Features that are required are typically things that are needed for the product to run correctly such as menus for restaurants and such. The next one is System outputs and what is outputted for the product. Are the customers getting everything they need from the system and are outputting everything correctly. You also need to make sure it is outputting everything they need to be successful and what they are asking for it to output. </p>

                            <p> The next scope we are going to focus on is Performance. How well the product performs and how well it works. How does it line up with the customers use and is it what they are asking for. You want to make sure that it is just giving results but you want to make sure it works great and is a quality product. You want it to be reliable and work very well. Does the product ever fail or have response time issues? Does the product every just shut off or sometimes not run correctly? Does it work in almost all situations? These are all things you need to know and make sure that the product is working correctly. This is so your customer is satisfied and you are confident you have a quality product for them. Another project scope that goes hand and hand with performance is reliability. Reliability is a big thing and want to make sure the product you have created has no problems or issues when running. You want to make sure the product isn't going to randomly go down and ever stop working. As a project manager you are wanting to make sure you have a quality product here you are giving your customer. This is including both of those performance and reliability. You want to make sure your product is always going to run smoothly and well under normal day to day circumstances and conditions. Lastly, we have maintainability. We want to make sure the product is easily maintainable so if a issue does arise or we want to upgrade the product or make any changes it needs to be easy to do this. It also needs to be kept up to date and so it wont go down and maintain its reliability. Also if your customer needs help maintaining the system or product you need to be able to help and fix the problem and maintain it in a reasonable timely manner and make sure things are easy fixes. </p>

                            <p> As you can see from all of the above there are many things that go into Quality Management and planning quality management. You want to make sure you are using all of the things above and creating a good quality product for your customers. Using all of that in the above you should have a out come of a good quality product that is going to be put to good use by the customer. Now you are becoming ready to start planning out your quality management and make sure everything goes well during your project. You need to make sure the Functionality and features are working well along with the system outputs, performance, reliability, and maintainability. If you do all of those and put emphasis on this you will have the outcome with a good product. Make sure the product has great reliability and will perform under normal every day conditions and that your product is performing how it needs to be and able to be maintained. Doing all of these above will help your product and have a good quality product that your customer will be pleased with. </p>
