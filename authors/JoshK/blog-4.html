                            <h3 class="card-title">Basic Principles of Cost Management</h3>
                            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><em>February 25, 2022</em></h6>
                            <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 10%;">
                            <p> There are many things that go into cost management in a project. As a project manager you need to know how to manage the cost of everything so you are able to finish your project. Tons of projects that start end up never finishing because of cost management and they run out of money to keep doing their projects. As a project manager you need to have well known knowledge about finances and the cost of your project. You need to know how to keep your inside budget without going over budget or running out of money. This can be a killer for projects that don't manage their money well and run out of money to use on their company. You also need to know how to calculate your return on investment. There are lots of concepts to learn with this so you can be successful and stay on budget. Also another big section to think about is how will this project return its value and plus more value or profit on your project then your investment is. You want this project to return more value to your and your company then your investment into this project was. </p>

                            <p> A big portion here is knowing if this project will bring you a profit. A project will not be worth it if you do not get a profit out of it whether that profit is money or profit through saving tons of time throughout a year. You need to know if this profit is also going to be big enough to be worth the time. Say you are going to be putting $1,000 dollars into this project and off this project you are going to profit $30 dollars it may not be worth it. You need to know how much this will help your company and how it will help them make money or save time in their company. When projects are brought up companies need to know how this will benefit their company and help them in the future and with making them more money. A company does not want to invest in something that is not going to be profitable for them in the future. </p>

                         <p>   Next thing we are going to go over here is talking about the life cycle of the project. How long is your project going to last? Think about is this project going to be worthless in 5 or 10 or 15 years? If it is you need to think about that when looking at profits. If you are going to profit $1,000 dollars a year of your project but in 2 years you are going to stop making profit off of it then its something to consider when looking at the project. Or the new project you completed could be there for 10 years before you need to do a new project on it. It just depends on how long you plan on having that project and how long it will last before you want a new one or upgrade. </P>

                            <p> Next is having a budget for your project. You need to know how much money you are going to need in order to complete this project. You also need to know how to spread this money out throughout the entire project. Build an outline of how much money is going to be spent on each section of the project. Out of your total overall budget break it down into sections and make sure not to spend too much money on each individual section as this is going to be bad and a cause for overspending. Tons of projects end up not being able to finish and have to stop because they weren't careful with the money they were budgeted for and have run out of money to be able to finish their project. This is why project managers need to know about financials and be well versed in finances. Typically projects will have some guidance and be assisted by financial experts that are in their company. These people will help them budget out their money for each section to make sure they are not spending too much or too little on each section and are able to stay within their budget that they are allowed to have by the company. You need to be able to also consider the life cycle of a project when deciding the project and also making any financial considerations with your project. </p>

                            <p> The next section we will be talking about is cash flow. What is cash flow? Cash flow is how much money is going to be brought in and also spent on this project when it is done. So in everyday business how much money is this bringing in and also how much money are we spending on keeping this up. This will also help to know if you can afford to keep this up compared to how much money this is bringing in. This number in cash flow will give you the net present value. If the cash flow is really high then the company may not be able to afford to keep this project up and running and have to shut it down because of it being too expensive to keep up and maintain throughout. </p>

                            <p> There are tons of things that go into the principles of cost management. This is just a start of how you should be considering your budget when looking at it and deciding how much needs to be spent on each section. There are more sections such as direct and indirect cost of your project which is how much you will be spending on your project when it is up and running and also other things you have to pay for that help keep it running. You also need to have money in a reserve so if anything happens and you need more money for a section or more money on your project in general you have the money to do so. You want to be able to afford any situations that arise if they do come at you. </p>
