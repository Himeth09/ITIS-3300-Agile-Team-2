                            <p> Validating scope is a very important process when it comes to projects and them finishing up. In this blog we will be talking about all about validating scope from what is validating scope to different steps in it. It’s one of the more important steps that a project manager needs to do and know how to do to help them be successful at what they do. There are lots of different subsections when it comes to validating scope. We will also be talking about how important validating scope is and how it can affect companies and their projects that they are having you work on. We will also be discussing project deliverables and also scope creep which are both very important to these steps of being a project manager. </p>

                            <p> First off lets start with what is validating scope? Validate scope is when all the deliverables in a project get accepted and reviewed. The stakeholders in the company that are investing in this project are having to look over all the deliverables to make sure everything is correct and went good in the project just how they want it to have happened. This is typically done at the end of the project to make sure that everything was done correctly and went according to plan. Its a list of everything that went into it such as meetings. What are project deliverables you may ask. Project deliverables everything that goes into a project such as all the planning and meetings that are held. Project deliverables is just everything that is going in to the project itself. You are given a statement of everything that has happened such as meetings that have happened and what has happened in those meetings and how your time has been spent throughout the process of the project. </p>
                            <p> Next a big thing in validate scope is something that is called scope creep. Scope creep is something that project managers need to be very careful about happening and not let this happen to them as many companies have been put out of business by it. Scope creeping is when you keep expanding on a project and making it bigger and bigger or having to order more things and just adding onto a project with accounting for it. This can be any thing from ordering more items, or keep adding things on to the project without accounting for it. Lots have went out of business and had to file for bankruptcy because of this. So when adding on to a project you have to be able to account for the financial aspects, the time aspects, and the overall project aspect. You do not want to be a reason a company has to file bankruptcy because of scope creeping. You have this big project and you don't want to keep adding on to make it this great big project. I agree about this being a big part that you need to understand because you can really hurt a company by having scope creep. Being a project manager is really important that you do understand this. You do not want to create this huge disaster because you want to keep making this project bigger and bigger. You need to meet the requirements you are given without making it bigger and having a bigger budget then you need. This can also be a part of spending lots of money in your project and getting no use out of it and not using it in your project at all. Everything needs to be planned out and make sure you are not wasting your money on products or softwares or such so that you are not wasting millions of dollars for your company. </p>


                            <p> For scope validation you also need great decision making skill as a project manager during this step. You need to make sure that everything is laid out and that you can change anything if it needs to be changed. So after all of these things during scope validation the stakeholders are going to look and inspect your project and validate everything you have done and make sure that it meets all of the requirements. They will make sure not only that it has met all of the requirements they have for you but also that it has stayed on budget. They will also be checking your project deliverables which is actually the main thing they will be checking to make sure those requirements are met. </p>
                            <p> Many project managers do struggle with scope validation from what I have read. It’s a really important process that needs to be made sure that it is going to go well when you get to this stage and the stakeholders have to look at everything and make sure that it has made all of their requirements. The biggest thing here is to not let scope creep affect you or the project that you are working on as a project manager. Scope creep can really hurt your business and your project really bad and many people have put a company out of business and force them to have to file bankruptcy as a company. I know these are extreme cases of scope creep but you want to make sure that this does not happen at all as you want the stakeholders and the management that look at this project and be happy about it and know that you have met all of their project requirements and needs with your project. Making sure that all of this is met so that your company will approve as well as the stakeholders is very important and shouldn’t be taken lightly. All of this needs to be taken into consideration when you are getting into your scope validation section of your project. The stakeholders want to see you succeed and make sure you met their requirements for their project. So take control of this project and help them and make it the best it can be for you and your companies needs and help them reach their goals as well as your goals. </p>
