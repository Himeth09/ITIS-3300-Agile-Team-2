                                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"><em>February 5, 2022</em></h6>
                                <p class="card-text" style="text-indent: 10%;">
                                    <p> There are many different methods when it comes to selecting projects in Project Management. You need to make sure your company needs what you are focusing on, their budget is correct, will it benefit them, and more. There are many important steps to take when being a project manager and we will be discussing these. There are also plenty of questions you need to ask which we will also be showing here. All of these methods will help you select projects as a project manager. </p>
                                
                                <p> To start off the first method we are gonna talk about is about the businesses needs. Project Managers need to know what projects to select for their companies and also when to select these projects. The reason they need to take certain ones and not others is because if a company actually needs these projects then they will likely be useful and successful compared to something not as much in demand. They need to be able to answer questions such as “How will this benefit our company?” or “Is this a problem to start with?”. It needs to be an opportunity to improve the company and help them be more successful. You also need to ask yourself if it meets all requirements that are asked by the company. Finally is it the right timing to start doing this project? Is the company in need of this right now? Is the funding available? These are all questions that need to be asked. The company needs to be in the right time to be able to move forward with the project. </p>
                                
                                <p> The next section we are going to discuss is the financial side of the projects. This part of the decision comes from all of the financial considerations of the project such as funding. Can the company afford to fund this project and is it worth funding for. Also will this be profitable for the company in the future. There is also net present value analysis that is used by seeing the net gains and losses from a project by seeing all the cost vs gains and seeing if this is a profitable project. This method will tell you if your project will be profitable or not on projections in the company. So a big thing on this is if the project will pay back itself or if it will be a loss by doing this project. There are multiple math equations to figure out how to know if your project is profitable. </p>
                                
                                <p> In our next section we have a weighted model for our project managers. A weighted model system is a process of you selecting projects based on the criteria inside the project. The criteria in the project is things like budget, what does the company need, time, financials and much more included. You then assign a certain weight to each criteria based on how important it is to the company. You are then wanting to rank each criteria to how important it is to each criteria that there is. This is usually decided within a group to see how each one meets the companies needs in the project. Everything during these rankings should be recorded such as disagreements on certain topics during rankings. There are many different ways to rank these and different companies use different ways but this is a standard one. This ties into the next approach. Next we need to make sure we have a balance scorecard. This means make sure that everything that is happening is being balanced and organized. There needs to be a strategy in place to make sure everything is planned accordingly. Every section is having a weight such as in our weighted model section and is being treated appropriately. </p>
                                
                                <p> Another thing to take into consideration in projects is opportunity cost. Is this project going to be worth the company's time? What you are figuring out here is the company can spend time working on other things while this project is going on. So this project will be taking away from something else from being worked on as the workers will be focused on this project. Will the time it takes for them to do this project be worth it for the company from taking away from another section of focus. Is this going to be worth it while the company can be focused on other projects or tasks? Will your employees be better off working on something else for your company? This is an important step as it could potentially be a waste of time taking a certain project rather than doing something else that could maximize your company's time and money. </p>
                                
                                <p> As you have seen above there are very many different ways that Project Managers need to think to decide if taking a project is worth the time or not. Project Managers need to understand all of these different pros and cons to doing each other's projects to know if it is worth it for them. We have discussed everything from financials to opportunity cost to businesses needs for their companies. You also need to understand your company's motives and their goals for their company so you can help accordingly. Also need to understand certain business strategies as it will help with managing the project you are on and make it as successful as can be. So as the Project Manager you need to be understanding of the importance of the project you are managing and know how this is going to greatly help your company grow and grow financially and not waste their time. You also need to understand the importance of each and every project and how it will help your company. Also being able to discuss with a team on how to effectively plan this will be greatly helpful. So, these are all things that should be taken into consideration with your company so you can get them the max they can for their time and their money while you are managing and deciding projects. </p>
