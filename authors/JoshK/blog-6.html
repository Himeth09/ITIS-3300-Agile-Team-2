<p> Here in this blog post we are going to be talking about developing your project team. As a project team you need to be able to put together a successful team to be able to develop this project. You need these people that you have working for you on your project to be well trained or able to be well trained. There are many sections to this process as you are getting a team and have them bong together. It's also about making sure your team works as a team and can work together and get to know each other well. There are many ways you can do these things that we will go over and make sure you have what you need to be successful. You also need to be able to make sure the team you are putting together are capable of working together and completing this project for you. </p>

                            <p>I am going to begin this section with the training section. It is highly recommended that project managers take training courses to learn interpersonal skills and people skills and how to develop a team. This is really important to have this training and know how to do this because you want to know how to make your team to be able to be successful and do well. If you ever run into problems you want to be able to fix them and learn how to help people and train them. You want to be able to help them learn how to become a team and know how to interact with them as well as fix issues that you may face in a team. Also the employees you are going to have to work on the team with also will need to be trained in what the project is going to be. You also need to be able to provide training for them if need be for the project they are going to be working on. A lot of companies use highly skilled people on these projects but they do still have to learn something new most of the time for these projects to help them be successful. All of this training for yourself and them needs to be able to get done in a fast and timely manner. Employees that are selected for this generally feel honored and rewarded when they are selected to be trained to do something on a project. This also helps with the rewards and recognition system which will be discussed later in the post. </p>

                            <p> In the next section we have team building activities. You need to have team building activities for your team so they can get to know each other and learn to become a team. In these activities you can learn about your team and get to know each of them individually and also have them meet each other and get to know each other. A common thing companies do is to give them a challenging activity and to see if they come  together as a team to solve it or if they fall apart and spread from each other. These activities that challenge them will help them learn more about themselves and also learn more about each other. This will also help them learn how to come together as a team and as a group and help solve their issues. </p>

                            <p> Now we are going to begin discussing the reward and recognition system. This system generally works very well but you will also sometimes find people trying to abuse the system. In this system you are generally looking at your employees and trying to find the best workers and employees. These people are generally working extremely hard or working overtime to help get ahead on a project or work extra to get more done. Companies tend to offer to these employees that they are finding to go above and beyond for the project some financial compensation like extra payment or travel rewards. These rewards typically make employees work harder to help meet the requirements that they need to. This is great for when you have a tight schedule and need things done quickly and employees are willing to work extra hours and extra hard to help you accomplish this goal that you have set. However, you will encounter employees who are trying to earn this by staying extra hours but they are only getting the normal amount of work done that they should be getting done. These employees typically are working extra hours so they get extra pay. The rewards and recognition system should be used on employees who are working extremely hard and not people who are staying extra because they have poor time management or get easily distracted from their work. Employees typically will strive to be recognized for their efforts and want the extra bonuses so they will strive to do as much as they can and be recognized for their dedication and hard work. </p>

                            <p> Overall this is all really good information to help become a better project manager and help develop your team. You really want to be able to help your employees and learn about them and also learn how to help them when situations arise. It is important to use these team building activities to help your employees learn about themselves and about each other. You want to make sure that your team is willing to work hard and work together. That's why putting them through activities such as challenging activities so they can learn how to be a team even when they are stressed. Itâ€™s very easy for team members to get caught up in their own work and also be scared to ask for help on their assignments when they don't know what to do. You want to make sure that your team is working together as a team and are able to complete these assignments together. There are more systems out there that can help improve your team and making them learn about themselves and also more activities that you can find and do research on to help learn how to develop your team into a team. </p>
