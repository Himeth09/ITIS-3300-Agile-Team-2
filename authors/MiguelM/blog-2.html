                                    One of the most important aspects of project management is having a clear idea of
                                    what the scope of a given project is. Undertaking a project without a clear scope is
                                    akin to searching for treasure without a map: a futile task. In the same way a lamp
                                    lights the way at night, good scope definition provides the team with a clear idea
                                    of the effort a project needs to come to fruition. The dream of every project
                                    manager is to have the least complications possible and deliver the highest quality
                                    product possible. And to achieve this goal, the first requirement is defining the
                                    scope of the project.</p><p>
                                    In the Agile framework, scope is everything. One author defines product scope as
                                    “the functions and features that characterize a product or a service” (wrike).
                                    Product scope is important because it guides and defines the work needed to
                                    accomplish in the project, in order to deliver a product that conforms to the
                                    required features as well as functions. In other words, it is impossible to produce
                                    a high-quality product without first knowing its exact requirements in order to
                                    inform the work that needs to be done in order to satisfy said requirements.</p><p>
                                    The other important scope in the Agile Project Management Framework is Project
                                    Scope. The aforementioned author also defines project scope as “the work that must
                                    be done in order to deliver a product according to the product's scope” (wrike).
                                    Product scope is the driver of project scope. One is a prerequisite for the other,
                                    and one cannot exist without the other. These two elements share a symbiotic
                                    relationship and are usually the cause of many projects’ success or failure.
                                    Furthermore, product scope and project scope are also requirements that must be
                                    defined before a plan can be developed to carry out a project.</p><p>
                                    Once Project Managers and Scrum Masters have met with stakeholders and secured the
                                    requirements for a project, the next step is to formally define the scope of the
                                    product and the project. The next step involves documenting the project scope in
                                    what is known as a ‘Project Scope Statement’. As abstract as the name might seem, a
                                    Project Scope Statement is simply “a written document that is used as the basis for
                                    project decisions down the line” (wrike). The goal of this document is to have a
                                    concrete foundation on which to base project decisions which will in turn affect the
                                    overall development of the project and its subsequent completion.</p><p>
                                    Having produced a Project Scope Statement, the next step of the planning process
                                    involves beginning what is known as Project Scope Management. An author defines
                                    project scope management as “a process that helps in determining and documenting the
                                    list of all the project goals, tasks, deliverables, deadlines, and budgets as a part
                                    of the planning process” (kissflow). Project Scope Management helps a Scrum Master
                                    or Project Manager to successfully compile all the product requirements, integrate
                                    them into the plans, and subsequently produce a suitable plan in order to carry out
                                    the development of the final product.</p><p>
                                    The benefits of having a well-defined Product and Project Scope cannot be
                                    understated. One of the greatest benefits is that it helps Project Managers
                                    accurately estimate the amount of resources, financial cost, and time investment
                                    that it will take each step of the project to be completed. Another important
                                    benefit that can be derived from good scope definition is the ability to assign
                                    clearly defined work responsibilities to every member in the team, which helps set
                                    expectations for project deliverables early in the project cycle.</p><p>
                                    However, when there is not a clear Product and Project Scope, Project Creep becomes
                                    a dangerous and very plausible pitfall. Project Creep can be thought of as “the
                                    ballooning of a project’s original goals” (Lucidchart). The effects of project creep
                                    can easily and swiftly cause the downfall of a project that was not long before on
                                    track to finish on the appointed time. With the indiscriminate introduction of
                                    unforeseen and unpredictable requirements, deadlines that were previously defined
                                    become bent and lose importance in the face of the new requirements. These dangers
                                    and many more are what having a good project definition spares Project Managers and
                                    Agile Scrum Masters.</p><p>
                                    Although Project Scope Definition happens early in the Project Development Cycle,
                                    its definition should become grow in both clearness and specificity with every
                                    passing day. Project Managers are responsible for refining the Scope along the
                                    project’s process in order to provide an increasingly clearer picture of what the
                                    final product should look like. This process, in turn, enables every member on the
                                    team to be of one mind and ensure that their specific tasks are being completed on
                                    time and up to the standards and requirements set forth by the Project Manager and
                                    incumbent stakeholders.</p><p>
                                    In contrast, when the Scope of a project remains stagnant and unchanged through the
                                    length of the project, the chances of pitfalls created by unclear expectations and
                                    deliverables rises and gives way to uncertainty within the team. Worst case
                                    scenario, the whole project must be scrapped because the scope didn’t adapt to
                                    minute changes made by stakeholders at various points of development, which causes
                                    the client to become disillusioned with the prospects of the final project and dumps
                                    the project.</p><p>
                                    Summarizing, good scope definition is central to a successful project. Like having a
                                    detailed itinerary when going on vacation, having good scope minimizes distractions,
                                    pitfalls and errors a team might be prone to during the development of a product. It
                                    is up to Project Managers and Agile Scrum Masters to lay out the groundwork in
                                    advance, so their teams have a clear understanding of the expectations and road
                                    ahead when developing a product. While having good scope definition is not a
                                    cure-all against all project pitfalls, it is one of the most effective deterrents of
                                    Scope Creep. In this way, a properly defined scope works as a deterrent against
                                    temptingly good ideas which come at different portions of the development process
                                    and can cause major delays in the production of deliverables and the achievement of
                                    milestones.</p>
