                                    Within Project Schedule Management, there is a step known as ‘Sequencing
                                    Activities’. This step is very important as it sets the pace for a project and the
                                    activities it involves. Setting an order to these activities also involves figuring
                                    out what their dependencies are. An author defines dependencies as “a relationship
                                    between two modeling elements, in which a change to one modeling element (the
                                    independent element) will affect the other modeling element (the dependent element)”
                                    (Wideman, 2017). The importance of understanding dependencies when choosing the
                                    order in which to perform activities within a project cannot be understated. Since
                                    modifying an independent element directly affects the dependent element in the same
                                    scope, a failure to understand how the two are connected will invariably have a
                                    negative effect on the outcome.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, another important reason for understanding dependencies between
                                    different activities is the fact that some activities need to be completed before
                                    others can be started. In some cases, some activities can be done in parallel, while
                                    some others may show a degree of overlap depending on the nature of the activity.
                                    Among the different types of existing dependencies, there are four that stand out
                                    the most as it relates to their respective reliance upon other activities within a
                                    project. The four dependencies are: Finish-to-start, Start-to-start,
                                    Finish-to-finish and Start-to-finish (airfocus). The Finish-to-Start dependency is
                                    usually the most recurring relationship between two different tasks. In this type of
                                    dependency, the previous task must be completed before the next task can begin.
                                    Another type of dependency is Start-to-start. This type of dependency requires the
                                    previous task to have started before the next dependency can start, and the finish
                                    type for either activity is not a factor. The next dependency is the
                                    Finish-to-finish type. In this dependency, the following task can only finish after
                                    the previous task has been completed. The start time of either activity is not a
                                    factor in this dependency. The last type of dependency is the Start-to-finish
                                    dependency. This dependency is the least recurring one between different tasks. This
                                    dependency requires the following activity to have already started and cannot be
                                    completed before the previous activity has been started also.</p>
                                    <p>Project dependencies are necessary for a variety of reasons, and it order to
                                    understand the reasoning behind the sequencing of the activities within a project,
                                    the need for these dependencies must also be understood. First off, Agile Scrum
                                    Masters must decide the order of these sequences of activities in the context of the
                                    project plan. Secondly, project managers must devise a tasks’ critical path in order
                                    to understand the length of time a given activity will take to complete. Another
                                    reason for dependencies is that managers also have the responsibility of identifying
                                    required resources to finish certain tasks, at the same time that they have to deal
                                    with possible scheduling conflicts. The next reason for dependencies is the fact
                                    that managers need to monitor and assign tasks that form the overarching project
                                    plan. One last reason project dependencies are necessary is because Scrum Masters
                                    must also identify and act on any chance that comes by to decrease the time it takes
                                    to complete each task in the project schedule.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally to the previously mentioned dependencies, there is also a different
                                    type of dependency that is important for Project Managers to understand in order to
                                    improve the process of sequencing activities. The first type of these dependencies
                                    is known as the Mandatory Dependency. These dependencies are also more commonly
                                    known as ‘Hard Logic’. Mandatory Dependencies are “either required by the law or
                                    contract and sometimes they are inherent in the nature of the work” (Malik, 2021).
                                    These dependencies are a factor that is outside of the scope of control of managers,
                                    and considered accidental in the overall development of the sequencing of
                                    activities. The next type of dependency is known as a Discretionary Dependency. This
                                    dependency takes the shape that the development team gives it and is dependent on
                                    the order the members in a team decide to complete the required activities by the
                                    project task at hand (Malik, 2021). The third type of dependency is known as an
                                    External Dependency. These, same as the Mandatory Dependencies, escape the scope of
                                    control of Project Managers and are usually performed and completed by members
                                    outside the development team within a project. The last type of dependency is known
                                    as the Internal Dependency and is usually given shape to by two different project
                                    activities (Malik, 2021). In contrast to the Mandatory and External Dependencies,
                                    however, the development team usually has complete control over the activities
                                    related to said dependency. These dependencies, in conjunction with the ones
                                    mentioned previously, work together to give Project Managers a good picture of what
                                    tasks need to be completed first, and which need to wait in order to be addressed in
                                    the overall scheme of things. </p>
                                    <p>One of the best tools to represent activity sequencing is network diagrams. A
                                    network diagram is “a graphical portrayal of the activities and events of a project”
                                    (AcqNotes,2021). Its role is to display the way in which each activity within a
                                    project relates to others, and the order of precedence between these. Another
                                    advantage of using these diagrams is that they make determining a project’s late
                                    starts and finishes easier, while also providing insight into how resources are
                                    being utilized and further allowing project managers the opportunity to create
                                    hypothetical scenarios in order to be prepared for the future. This wealth of
                                    information enables managers to oversee the status of given plan or process and
                                    evaluate alternate routes of progress.</p>
                                    <p>There are several benefits to be reaped from implementing a network diagram. One of
                                    these is that these diagrams provide a manager with the ability to track every
                                    element of the project and enables them to better understand its current status.
                                    Another benefit is the ability to communicate project progress to the pertinent
                                    stakeholders. Also, these diagrams make it easy to design project workflows and use
                                    them to track different types of dependencies within a project’s tasks. Lastly,
                                    these diagrams also make it easier for managers to accurately represent project
                                    bottlenecks which could potentially become a problem to the project’s overall
                                    progress.</p>
