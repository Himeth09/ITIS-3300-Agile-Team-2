                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>In today’s modern world, it’s hard to find a company who doesn’t do some sort of
                                    outsourcing. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines outsourcing as “to procure
                                    (something, such as some goods or services needed by a business or organization)
                                    from outside sources and especially from foreign or nonunion suppliers”
                                    (Merriam-Webster). There are many reasons why outsourcing is very often the
                                    preferred way of companies acquiring the necessary resources. Some of the reasons
                                    often include better prices overseas or outside the country, cheaper labor, less
                                    legal restrictions, among others. This term leads us to a word very close in
                                    meaning: procurement. The aforementioned Dictionary defines procurement as “to
                                    obtain (something) by particular care and effort” (Merriam-Webster). Purchasing
                                    products and services from a third party is referred to as procurement. In the
                                    government, the phrase procurement is generally used; in the private sector, the
                                    terms purchase and outsourcing are commonly employed. Suppliers, vendors,
                                    contractors, subcontractors, and sellers are names used to describe organizations or
                                    persons who offer procurement services; among these categories, suppliers is the
                                    most often used. </p>
                                <h4>Importance of Procurement</h4>
                                <p>Many IT initiatives necessitate the usage of items and services
                                    obtained from outside the company. By simple linguistics, an outside source is a
                                    source that is not part of a given team or company. This means that the project team
                                    can be a supplier to another group within the company, or the project team can be a
                                    supplier to another group inside the organization. Many IT departments in
                                    corporations compete directly with outside suppliers, and they must follow the same
                                    criteria definitions, statements of work, and bids. Regardless of who offers the
                                    services to whom, the principles and techniques of solid project procurement
                                    processes are good to follow.</p>
                                <h4>Advantages of Outsourcing</h4>
                                <p>Now let’s explore the advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing. There are at least
                                    four major advantages in play when companies decide to outsource: cost, access to
                                    skills, manufacturing capabilities, and taking advantage of time zones (Logue,
                                    2021). Outsourcing an activity is frequently less expensive than hiring employees to
                                    perform the task. This is especially true if the task may be outsourced to a region
                                    of the country where the average wage is lower or to a country where the pay rate is
                                    much lower. One reason a company might outsource is to acquire access to expertise
                                    and services it wouldn't otherwise be able to get. A small firm, for example, may
                                    not be able to afford to maintain a high-end graphic designer on staff, but it may
                                    be able to hire one to design a logo. Many organizations have discovered that
                                    outsourcing allows them to locate higher-level programming, bookkeeping, and human
                                    resources talents than hiring in-house. Many businesses excel in product design and
                                    marketing but lack the capacity to create them. To obtain the items, they hire a
                                    business that specializes in manufacturing. Many firms have discovered that
                                    outsourcing work to workers in other time zones allows them to do more work in less
                                    time. By outsourcing to call centers in India and the Philippines, for example, a US
                                    corporation may provide 24-hour customer assistance. When a Swedish investment bank
                                    hires freelance editors in the United States to work on reports while Europe is
                                    sleeping, it can turn them around faster. </p>
                                <h4>Procurement Phases and Planning </h4>
                                <p>Once a company has decided on which goods to procure from which company, there are
                                    four steps in order to secure said goods. The steps, in order, are: plan procurement
                                    management, conduct procurements, control procurements, and close procurements
                                    (Landau, 2018). Procurements are first identified during the project's planning
                                    phase. A statement of work (SOW) is required for every external contractor to serve
                                    as a document defining the job to be contracted. Prior to the contract, however, a
                                    request for proposal is issued, in which different contractors are invited to bid on
                                    the task and the project manager is able to select who will be awarded the contract
                                    based on their proposals. These requests are well-thought-out, as they serve as
                                    project guiding papers. It's preferable if they're as specific as possible. This
                                    prevents subsequent misunderstanding and aids in the development of more precise
                                    plans. The procurement management plan, which comprises requirement papers, a risk
                                    register, activity resource needs, a project timeline, activity cost estimates, and
                                    more, collects this information. There are tools and approaches to assist guide
                                    these decisions, such as make-or-buy analysis, which determines if a task requires
                                    an external provider or can be completed in-house. Getting professional advice,
                                    conducting market research, and meeting with stakeholders may all assist you make
                                    this decision.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Conducting Procurements</h4>
                                <p>Following the completion of the first phase's documentation, the conduct procurement
                                    step involves analyzing the bids received and deciding which one to accept. However,
                                    before making a decision, a criterion should be in place to determine which proposal
                                    is better for the project and suits your logistics management. Following that, the
                                    contracts are signed, and the project management plan is revised. Determine the
                                    winner by conferring with bidders, use methodologies for analyzing offers, and
                                    obtaining independent estimates to ensure that the bids are within the typical
                                    range. It's never a bad idea to seek the opinion of specialists in the fields where
                                    you're contracting. You can also use analytical approaches to help you. Advertising
                                    allows you to cast the biggest net possible, allowing you to make decisions based on
                                    all potential bids. Then there will be procurement talks to fine-tune the final
                                    contracts to fit both your and the contractor's requirements. A purchase order
                                    should be used to document the price, quantity, delivery window, and payment
                                    conditions for the goods/services you want. It's a legally enforceable contract that
                                    ensures you and your vendor are on the same page. Our purchase order template can

                                <h4>Procurement Control</h4>
                                <p>Once the contracts are signed, the contractors' management must be integrated into
                                    the overall management duties. Contractors may wreak havoc on finances and
                                    deadlines, causing a project to go behind schedule or worse. As a result, regular
                                    status updates are required to evaluate contractor agreements, get progress reports,
                                    and assess job performance to ensure that contractors are following the contract
                                    criteria. Even if you engage contractors because they are specialists in their
                                    field, you must still supervise and track their work to ensure that it is moving
                                    according to plan. To ensure that the work is progressing well, contract a change
                                    control system and conduct frequent procurement performance reviews, including
                                    inspections and audits. Managers benefit from performance reports as well. A payment
                                    system, as well as a claims administration and records management system, must be in
                                    place. To assist performance monitoring, work orders must include full details
                                    regarding the job being performed by contractors.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Finalizing Procurements</h4>
                                <p>Just as there must be a mechanism in place to begin the procurement, there must also
                                    be one in place to complete it. What constitutes finished work should be specified
                                    in the original agreement with the contractor so that neither party is confused
                                    about when the job is completed. A formal release of liability is frequently
                                    required for insurance and bonding. This ensures that there are no pending
                                    modifications to the contract's value and completion date. Procurement audits help
                                    with this process, as well as having structured procurement negotiations. A records
                                    management system will also be needed to manage all the paperwork that will be
                                    involved with this stage of the procurement process.</p>
                                <!-- <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>In conclusion, project management touches on a variety of critical subjects such as
                                    motivation, influence, power, effectiveness, emotional intelligence, and leadership.
                                    Project managers and team members must grasp and practice essential ideas linked to
                                    these issues since projects are done by and for people. Remember that everyone loves
                                    to work with individuals they like and respect, therefore treating others with
                                    respect, regardless of their title or position, is essential. This is especially
                                    true for persons who work in support professions like administrative assistants,
                                    security guards, and cleaning crew members. Everyone has an important part to play.
