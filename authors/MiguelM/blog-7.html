                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>Communication is probably the most important factor in success or failure of any
                                    interpersonal relationship. Therefore, since society is composed of people who can’t
                                    read each other’s minds, it follows that communication also plays an essential role
                                    in the success and failure of relationships at all other levels as well. This is
                                    especially true when it comes to Communication in the context of Project Management.
                                    The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines communication as “a process by which
                                    information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols,
                                    signs, or behavior” (Merriam-Webster). Good communication, therefore, can be defined
                                    as the effective and accurate exchange of information between two entities. Within
                                    the realm of Project Management, the responsibility to manage communications lies
                                    not only with the Project Manager, but also with every member of the team, to ensure
                                    that all information conveyed helps to further the goals the team has set for
                                    themselves beforehand. </p>
                                <h4>Technology in Communication</h4>
                                <p>When utilized correctly, technology may make the process of generating and
                                    disseminating knowledge easier. E-mail, instant messaging, websites, telephones,
                                    cell phones, texting, and other technologies are used by the majority of individuals
                                    and organizations to communicate. You may develop and organize project
                                    documentation, timetables, meeting minutes, and client requests in an electronic
                                    format using a project management information system. This data can be saved locally
                                    or on the cloud. Electronically storing templates and examples of project papers can
                                    make standard forms more accessible, making information exchange easier. Backup
                                    measures should also be in place in the event that typical communications methods
                                    fail. The communication technique and medium are two crucial factors to consider
                                    when determining which technologies to utilize. </p>
                                <h4>Types of Communication</h4>
                                <p>Technologies are not the only factors that affect the delivery of communication;
                                    there are also different types of communication which help the message be delivered
                                    in the best possible way in order to convey the original message. There are three
                                    main types of communication: interactive communication, push communication, and pull
                                    communication. An expert defines interactive communication as “simultaneous and
                                    continually occurring messages that account for the manner in which previous
                                    messages react to other messages” (IGI Global). The word "interactive communication"
                                    is self-explanatory. It is a multidirectional kind of communication, as the name
                                    implies. When you need a quick response and the information you're sharing is
                                    sensitive and might be misunderstood, interactive communication is the way to go. It
                                    entails one or more individuals sharing ideas and thoughts in real time, with
                                    participants responding in kind. Another type of communication is push
                                    communication. This communication type is usually understood as “communication that
                                    is delivered by the sender to the recipients” (PMLS). This type of communication
                                    goes from sender to recipient, and it's best when you're disseminating information
                                    but don't need a quick response—or if the information you're attempting to transmit
                                    isn't urgent or sensitive. However, as soon as the recipient sees the message, he or
                                    she must take action. Memos, letters, emails, reports, faxes, and other forms of
                                    push communication are examples. It is usually done through a textual medium rather
                                    than face-to-face. One drawback of this kind of communication is that the sender can
                                    only tell if the message was delivered properly. Although some email systems can
                                    tell you when an email has been opened, this function does not guarantee that the
                                    receiver has comprehended the content. The last type of communication is pull
                                    communication. Pull communication is usually defined as “a communication method that
                                    provides access to the information however the receiver must proactively retrieve
                                    the information” (PMLS). Pull communication does not include enlisting the help of a
                                    reader to read your message. Pull communication, on the other hand, is all about
                                    giving a group of people access to the same information. The receiver, on the other
                                    hand, must retrieve this data. This strategy is employed when there is a huge group
                                    of people that need information. Use this type of material when your conversation is
                                    informational. It will have no impact on the project if a recipient does not read
                                    your communication. Pull communication is regarded to be the most suitable type of
                                    communication since information will only be accessible when the need arises.
                                    Posting information on websites, wikis, knowledge repositories, bulletin boards, and
                                    other places is one example of pull communication.

                                <h4>Performance Reporting Tools</h4>
                                <p>Performance reporting is another crucial technique for managing project
                                    communications. Stakeholders are kept informed about how resources are being used to
                                    meet project goals through performance reporting. It also encourages employees to
                                    report on their success. Progress reports are regarded as a fantastic tool—one that
                                    is widely utilized and proven to boost project performance. Progress or status
                                    reports are common formats for performance reporting. Many people confuse the two
                                    names, although some people note significant differences between them. A progress
                                    report is a “document that shows the progress that your team is making towards
                                    completing a project” (ScrumGenius). This report is essentially a project management
                                    method for preventing problems before they arise, ensuring that the project is
                                    completed on schedule, and keeping all stakeholders informed about the project's
                                    progress. The frequency with which the progress report should be submitted (daily,
                                    weekly, monthly, etc.) will be determined by the extent and complexity of the
                                    project. The other tool for effectively reporting performance is status reports.
                                    These can be defined as “a communication tool that project managers use to keep tabs
                                    on their employees’ work experiences” (ScrumGenius). A weekly status report can be
                                    done in person, but it's much easier to conduct it online. The report will be used
                                    by team members/employees to inform their supervisor about their emotional or
                                    project-based development for the current and next weeks. As a project manager or
                                    team lead, a weekly status report is one of the most effective methods to
                                    communicate with your team. The report will be used by a good team leader to assess
                                    a team's weekly progress on projects or emotional well-being. Weekly status updates
                                    allow you to have shorter meetings and increase workplace openness. The reports also
                                    make it possible for teams to collaborate in a seamless manner. </p>
                                <!-- <h4>McClelland's Acquired-Needs Theory</h4>
                                <p>Instead of the two categories outlined in Herzberg's theory, psychologist David
                                    McClelland's acquired-needs theory divides employee needs into three. Achievement,
                                    affinity, and power are the three categories (lumen). Employees that are highly
                                    accomplishment motivated are motivated by a desire to master new skills. They like
                                    to work on activities of intermediate complexity where the results are the result of
                                    their effort rather than chance. They value constructive criticism on their work.
                                    Affiliation-motivated employees are motivated by the need to form and maintain
                                    social ties. They want to feel loved and welcomed and appreciate being a part of a
                                    group. They may not be successful managers because they are overly concerned with
                                    how others see them. Power-motivated employees are motivated by a desire to
                                    influence, teach, or inspire others. They like their jobs and place a strong
                                    emphasis on discipline. They may, however, take a zero-sum approach to group labor,
                                    in which one person must lose or fail for another to win or succeed. However, if
                                    directed correctly, this may assist individuals in the group feel capable while also
                                    supporting collective goals.</p> -->
                                <!-- <h4>McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y</h4>
                                <p>Douglas McGregor, a social psychologist, established two opposing ideas in the 1960s
                                    to explain how managers' perceptions about what drives their employees might
                                    influence their management style (MindTools). These he labeled Theory X and Theory
                                    Y. Even now,
                                    these theories are still relevant. Theory X supervisors have a gloomy attitude
                                    toward their employees, assuming that they are innately uninspired and detest their
                                    jobs. Work in such companies may be monotonous, and individuals are frequently
                                    motivated using a "carrot and stick" strategy. Performance assessments and
                                    remuneration are often based on measurable outcomes, like as sales numbers or
                                    product output, and are used to monitor and regulate employees. Theory Y managers
                                    have a positive attitude toward their employees and manage in a decentralized,
                                    participatory manner. This motivates managers and their team members to work
                                    together more collaboratively and trustingly. Managers push employees to enhance
                                    their abilities and recommend improvements as they take on more responsibility.
                                    Appraisals are held on a regular basis, but they are intended to foster open
                                    dialogue rather than to manage employees, as they are in Theory X businesses.</p>
                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>In conclusion, project management touches on a variety of critical subjects such as
                                    motivation, influence, power, effectiveness, emotional intelligence, and leadership.
                                    Project managers and team members must grasp and practice essential ideas linked to
                                    these issues since projects are done by and for people. Remember that everyone loves
                                    to work with individuals they like and respect, therefore treating others with
                                    respect, regardless of their title or position, is essential. This is especially
                                    true for persons who work in support professions like administrative assistants,
                                    security guards, and cleaning crew members. Everyone has an important part to play.
