                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>One of the most important and at the same time difficult aspects of Project
                                    Management is managing and leading people effectively. Where to start? What does it
                                    entail? What are the best practices? One of the most influential aspects that affect
                                    people’s performance at work is the psychological one. This affects not only
                                    performance, but also other factors like motivation, leadership, influence, and the
                                    like. Luckily, there are many scientists and researchers who have paved the way in
                                    this field and have shed much needed knowledge into the factors that affect a
                                    person’s psychological state of being. </p>
                                <h4>Motivation Types</h4>
                                <p>Why do people act the way they do? Is there a reason? Is there a pattern? An expert
                                    from the University of Rochester defines extrinsic motivation as “completing a task
                                    or exhibiting a behavior because of outside causes such as avoiding punishment or
                                    receiving a reward” (Sennett, 2021). Additionally, Sennett also defines intrinsic
                                    motivation as “performing a task because it’s personally rewarding to you” (Sennett,
                                    2021). In other words, there are two different directions that shape the reason why
                                    someone acts at any given time. In certain circumstances, extrinsic incentive is
                                    advantageous. Working for a reward, for example, might be beneficial when you need
                                    to finish an activity that you would otherwise dislike. Intrinsic motivation, on the
                                    other hand, is usually a more successful long-term strategy for attaining objectives
                                    and completing activities in a way that makes you happy. Extrinsic motivation can be
                                    beneficial in some settings, but it can also contribute to burnout or loss of
                                    efficacy over time. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can sometimes complement each
                                    other to help you finish a job. If you have a job and are working on a project, for
                                    example, you may be extrinsically driven to complete it in order to meet a
                                    teammate's deadline. It's possible that you're organically motivated to do it
                                    because you enjoy the endeavor and want to perform well. </p>
                                <h4>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h4>
                                <p>Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological motivational theory that consists of a
                                    five-tier model of human wants, which is sometimes shown as hierarchical tiers
                                    within a pyramid (McLeod, 2007). Physiological (food and clothes), safety (job
                                    security), love and belonging needs (friendship), esteem, and self-actualization are
                                    the needs from the bottom of the hierarchy up. Individuals must attend to
                                    lower-level demands before they can attend to higher-level requirements. There are
                                    two types of requirements in this five-stage model: deficit and growth. Deficiency
                                    needs (D-needs) correspond to the first four levels, whereas growth or being needs
                                    refers to the highest level (B-needs). Deficiency needs emerge as a result of
                                    deprivation, and they are believed to motivate people when they are not satisfied.
                                    Furthermore, the longer such wants go unmet, the stronger the drive to meet them
                                    becomes. Physiological needs - these are biological need for human life, such as
                                    air, food, drink, shelter, clothes, warmth, sex, and sleep, to name a few. The human
                                    body cannot operate efficiently if these demands are not met. Once an individual's
                                    physiological demands have been met, the need for security and safety becomes more
                                    important. After physiological and safety requirements are met, the third level of
                                    human wants is social, which includes emotions of belonging. Self-worth,
                                    accomplishment, and respect are among the fourth level of Maslow's hierarchy of
                                    needs. The highest level in Maslow's hierarchy, self-actualization needs relate to
                                    the realization of a person's potential, self-fulfillment, personal progress, and
                                    peak experiences.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory</h4>
                                <p>The two-factor motivation theory, also known as Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory
                                    or dual-factor theory, claims that there are two sets of mutually incompatible
                                    elements that generate job satisfaction or unhappiness in the workplace (Nickerson,
                                    2021). In general, these variables that promote job happiness have to do with
                                    self-development and self-actualization. Motivators, according to Herzberg, assured
                                    job contentment, but a lack of hygienic elements bred job satisfaction. Since then,
                                    the two-factor motivation theory has become one of the most often utilized
                                    theoretical frameworks in the field of job satisfaction research. Maslow (1954),
                                    Herzberg, Vroom (1964), Alderfer (1972), McCalland (1961), and Locke et al. (1981) —
                                    the key mid-twentieth-century motivation researchers — produced studies that
                                    Basset-Jones and Lloyd suggest may be separated into content and process theories of
                                    motivation. Content theories, such as those proposed by Herzberg et al. (1959),
                                    imply a complex interplay between internal and external elements and investigate how
                                    humans respond to various internal and external stimuli. Meanwhile, process
                                    theories, such as Vroom's (1964), look at how internal variables influence a
                                    person's behavior.</p>
                                <h4>McClelland's Acquired-Needs Theory</h4>
                                <p>Instead of the two categories outlined in Herzberg's theory, psychologist David
                                    McClelland's acquired-needs theory divides employee needs into three. Achievement,
                                    affinity, and power are the three categories (lumen). Employees that are highly
                                    accomplishment motivated are motivated by a desire to master new skills. They like
                                    to work on activities of intermediate complexity where the results are the result of
                                    their effort rather than chance. They value constructive criticism on their work.
                                    Affiliation-motivated employees are motivated by the need to form and maintain
                                    social ties. They want to feel loved and welcomed and appreciate being a part of a
                                    group. They may not be successful managers because they are overly concerned with
                                    how others see them. Power-motivated employees are motivated by a desire to
                                    influence, teach, or inspire others. They like their jobs and place a strong
                                    emphasis on discipline. They may, however, take a zero-sum approach to group labor,
                                    in which one person must lose or fail for another to win or succeed. However, if
                                    directed correctly, this may assist individuals in the group feel capable while also
                                    supporting collective goals.</p>
                                <h4>McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y</h4>
                                <p>Douglas McGregor, a social psychologist, established two opposing ideas in the 1960s
                                    to explain how managers' perceptions about what drives their employees might
                                    influence their management style (MindTools). These he labeled Theory X and Theory Y. Even now,
                                    these theories are still relevant. Theory X supervisors have a gloomy attitude
                                    toward their employees, assuming that they are innately uninspired and detest their
                                    jobs. Work in such companies may be monotonous, and individuals are frequently
                                    motivated using a "carrot and stick" strategy. Performance assessments and
                                    remuneration are often based on measurable outcomes, like as sales numbers or
                                    product output, and are used to monitor and regulate employees. Theory Y managers
                                    have a positive attitude toward their employees and manage in a decentralized,
                                    participatory manner. This motivates managers and their team members to work
                                    together more collaboratively and trustingly. Managers push employees to enhance
                                    their abilities and recommend improvements as they take on more responsibility.
                                    Appraisals are held on a regular basis, but they are intended to foster open
                                    dialogue rather than to manage employees, as they are in Theory X businesses.</p>
                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>In conclusion, project management touches on a variety of critical subjects such as
                                    motivation, influence, power, effectiveness, emotional intelligence, and leadership.
                                    Project managers and team members must grasp and practice essential ideas linked to
                                    these issues since projects are done by and for people. Remember that everyone loves
                                    to work with individuals they like and respect, therefore treating others with
                                    respect, regardless of their title or position, is essential. This is especially
                                    true for persons who work in support professions like administrative assistants,
                                    security guards, and cleaning crew members. Everyone has an important part to play.
