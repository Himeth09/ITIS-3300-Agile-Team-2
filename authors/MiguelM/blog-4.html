                                    Webster's dictionary defines cost as 'something given up in exchange' (Webster).
                                    Costs are often measured in monetary amounts, such as dollars, that must be paid to
                                    acquire goods and services. Websites use a range of cost- or income-related metrics
                                    to measure the cost of a purchase, so it is important that they are properly
                                    defined. For example: a site can display a price for a product or service, which is
                                    * a number that describes the price of the product. It can also be a percentage of
                                    an hourly wage or a fixed cost, a service or labor cost. A price per unit (e.g., per
                                    hour, per day, per month) can use the same definition. Price is used in many forms,
                                    including as a unit of measure. Some web sites allow users to enter a cost estimate
                                    and see a breakdown of their cost per click. This can help visitors better
                                    understand the costs of search engine optimization. Another way of looking at the
                                    term is to consider it to be 'a unit for measuring cost.'</p>
                                    <p>Cost management is an important element in project management since it entails the
                                    procedures that must be followed to guarantee that a project team completes a
                                    project within the allocated budget. The cost of any work is the price paid by the
                                    customer to a provider in exchange for the goods or services the provider provides.
                                    The cost management processes in a business are the way in which the business
                                    accounts for costs to determine how much the company should bill the customers for
                                    all the services it provides as well as the costs it must incur to deliver the
                                    service. The cost is also known as billable cost, variable cost and indirect cost.
                                    Cost management in Project management has four components: cost planning, cost
                                    estimation, cost determination, and cost control. Each component helps to manage the
                                    cost effectively.</p>
                                    <p>First off, cost management planning includes identifying the rules, methods, and
                                    documentation that will be utilized for project cost planning, execution, and
                                    control. A cost management strategy is the key product of this approach. Secondly,
                                    developing an approximation or estimate of the expenses of the resources required to
                                    accomplish a project is known as cost estimation. Activity cost estimates,
                                    foundation of estimates, and project document updates are the key outputs of the
                                    cost estimating process. Thirdly, allocating the total cost estimate to individual
                                    work items to provide a baseline for monitoring performance is part of determining
                                    the budget. A cost baseline, project financing requirements, and project document
                                    changes are the major outcomes of the cost budgeting process. Lastly, controlling
                                    expenses entails keeping tabs on the project's budget. Work performance information,
                                    cost predictions, change requests, project management plan updates, and project
                                    document updates are the major outputs of the cost control process.</p>
                                    <p>Many IT initiatives never get started because IT experts don't know how to make a
                                    business case for them. Important ideas to master for a better understanding of
                                    project cost management include net present value analysis, return on investment,
                                    and payback analysis. Also, a basic understanding of the underlying principles of
                                    economics can go a long way in developing a more complete picture of the costs
                                    involved in a project. Revenues minus outgoings equals profits. A corporation can
                                    boost profits by increasing sales, cutting costs, or combining the two. Profits are
                                    more important to most CEOs than other considerations. When it comes to justifying
                                    new information system expenditures, there are a few things to keep in mind. It's
                                    critical to concentrate on the influence on profitability, rather than merely
                                    revenues or costs, when it comes to innovation and technology. Without knowing the
                                    profit margin, any program in question would be useless. The profit margin is the
                                    percentage of revenue that is made up of profits. A profit margin of 2% means that
                                    $100 in revenue generates $2 in profit. There is a 22 percent profit margin if the
                                    corporation loses $2 for every $100 in revenue.</p>
                                    <p>Another important concept to know is what life cycle costing is in the context of
                                    Project Management. A big-picture view of a project's cost throughout its life cycle
                                    is provided by life cycle costing. This aids in the development of an accurate
                                    financial cost and benefit prediction for a project. The entire cost of ownership,
                                    or development plus support expenses, for a project is considered in life cycle
                                    costing. The approach of estimating the projected yearly expenses and benefits for a
                                    project, as well as the resulting annual cash flow, is known as cash flow analysis.
                                    To calculate net present value, project managers must undertake a cash flow
                                    analysis. Most people grasp the fundamental notion of cash flow: they can't buy
                                    something if they don't have enough money in their wallets or bank accounts. When
                                    deciding which initiatives to invest in, top management must consider cash flow
                                    considerations.</p>
                                    <p>Costs and benefits can be classified as tangible or intangible, depending on how
                                    effectively a company can identify the expected costs and benefits for a project. In
                                    dollars, tangible costs or advantages are straightforward to calculate. Intangible
                                    costs and benefits, on the other hand, are difficult to quantify in terms of money.
                                    Assume Juan and a few others used their personal time to conduct research on topics
                                    pertinent to the study utilizing government-owned computers, books, and other
                                    resources. Direct costs are those that are directly tied to the creation of the
                                    project's products and services. Direct expenses might be assigned to a specific
                                    project. Direct expenses, for example, include the pay of full-time project
                                    employees as well as the cost of gear and software acquired particularly for the
                                    project. Direct costs can be managed, thus project managers should concentrate on
                                    these.</p>
                                    <p>Indirect expenses are costs that are not directly connected to the project's goods
                                    or services, but are indirectly tied to the project's completion. In a huge facility
                                    with 1,000 people working on many projects, indirect expenses may include the cost
                                    of energy, paper towels, and other essentials. Project managers have relatively
                                    limited influence over indirect expenditures, which are given to projects. Money
                                    that has already been spent is referred to as sunk cost. As if it were a sinking
                                    ship that could never be resurrected. Sunk expenses should not be considered when
                                    determining which initiatives to invest in or continue. According to the learning
                                    curve principle, when more units are produced, the unit cost of those products drops
                                    in a predictable fashion. Contingency reserves are included in the project cost
                                    baseline to account for future scenarios that can only be partially anticipated
                                    (also known as known unknowns). Unpredictable future situations are accommodated by
                                    management reserves (sometimes called unknown unknowns).</p>
