                                    <h4>Definition and Context</h4>
                                    <p>Project Quality Management is often regarded as a rather complex topic within the
                                    context of Project Management. However, for the sake of having a point of reference,
                                    an author defines Project Quality Management as “the planning, scoping,
                                    implementing, and monitoring of quality into all phases of the project from concept
                                    through the delivery aspects of the work” (Patterson, 1983). While the context may
                                    indicate that "quality" denotes "perfection," it is typically more about
                                    establishing consistency in quality throughout a project in this example. However,
                                    what is meant by "quality" depends on what the client or stakeholder expects from
                                    the project, and so varies from project to project. Quality management and project
                                    management are complimentary in today's world. They both place a premium on client
                                    happiness and the assumption that quality leads to customer contentment. The primary
                                    goal of project quality management is to ensure that the project fits the needs for
                                    which it was designed—nothing more, nothing less. To put it another way, you must
                                    fulfill the demands of the stakeholder to assure quality. Project quality
                                    management, on the other hand, does not include meeting or surpassing standards. It
                                    is the project manager's and project management team's obligation to strike a
                                    balance between quality and grade (a category or rank assigned to products or
                                    services having the same functional use but different technical
                                    characteristics).This duty guarantees that quality standards are met. This suggests
                                    that while having a low-quality, high-quality product is conceivable and
                                    justifiable, having a low-quality product is never acceptable. The requirements are
                                    established with the stakeholders at the start of the project. These specifications
                                    serve as the foundation for the project's work. After then, the project manager's
                                    role is to make sure that everything runs well. Giving the consumer additional or
                                    doing extra work is not what quality is about. The concept of extras is frequently
                                    founded on erroneous assumptions about what the buyer wants. These add time, money,
                                    and other disadvantages to a project, but they don't necessarily result in higher
                                    client satisfaction.</p>
                                <h4>Conformance to Requirements</h4>
                                    <p>Another important concept to understand in order to gain a better understanding of
                                    Project Quality Management is conformance to requirements. An expert in the field
                                    defines conformance requirements as “are the expression, in the form of a statement,
                                    which conveys the criteria to be fulfilled” (Rosenthal, 2001). A project management
                                    plan's quality assurance relies heavily on conformance. Without it, the project's
                                    overall performance will suffer. Conformance, by definition, is a notion that
                                    produces a result that is within the quality requirement's acceptable range. This
                                    indicates that conformance refers to a product's, service's, or process' capacity to
                                    fulfill the buyer's and customer's intended standards. Conformance is viewed as
                                    something that is acceptable because the specification is a representation of what
                                    the buyers need. Conformance is normally measured within an allowable tolerance
                                    range, therefore a product that falls inside that range has a good conformance
                                    quality. Conformance is a project management strategy for tracking a product's or
                                    service's long-term viability. The product or service is evaluated near the
                                    performance barrier that has been specified. The measurement is in compliance with
                                    the standards if it stays within the bounds. If this is not the case, management
                                    focuses on the product or service and corrects the problem. It is difficult for
                                    project managers to establish the acceptance of their product, service, or process
                                    without compliance.</p>
                                    <h4>Fitness For Use</h4>
                                    <p>A very important idea in Project Quality Management involves the idea of how apt a
                                    product or service is for use. Speaking on the subject, an expert defines fitness of
                                    use as “taking customers' requirements and expectations into account, which involves
                                    whether the products or services fit their uses”(Stefanska). Because various
                                    consumers may utilize things in different ways, products must include diverse
                                    characteristics of fitness in order to be used. Each of these characteristics is a
                                    quality feature, and they may all be categorized into metrics for suitability for
                                    use. The suitability of information is determined by comparing its quality elements
                                    to a set of standards that indicate the equivalent acceptable quality components.
                                    The standards are established using the same components that are used to describe
                                    data quality in order to simplify direct comparison. The allowed margin of
                                    uncertainty in the final decision ultimately determines information standards. The
                                    benefit of fitness for use is that it allows for less stringent standards in most
                                    circumstances. This is far more efficient in terms of the time periods and expenses
                                    associated with Risk Management tasks. Furthermore, many scientists, consultants,
                                    and regulators, as well as the general public. The idea of fitness for usage is
                                    rational. This notion is based on the premise that, like most things in life,
                                    objects must be designed for a specific, proper function. A garage, for example,
                                    must be adequate for storing a car rather than serving as a children's playground.</p>
                                    <h4>Processes of Quality Management</h4>
                                    <p>Project Quality Management can be easily broken down into three main processes in
                                    terms of quality: planning, assurance, and control. The formulation of quality
                                    measurements is one of the most crucial components of quality planning. Beyond the
                                    usual measures of scope, time, and money, project managers must think beyond the
                                    box. It is critical to connect a project to the company's, organization's, or
                                    business unit's strategic goals. According to the article Project Management & Six
                                    Sigma, Use Six Sigma Methods for Better Project Results (Rever, 2006), a project
                                    manager's efforts on each project he or she is overseeing should result in some sort
                                    of business improvement. This is, after all, why a project exists: to improve some
                                    aspect of the business. Measuring progress is necessary to demonstrate progress. It
                                    is critical for a project manager to have active attention, engagement, and support
                                    from important sponsor. The quality assurance process is linked to process analysis and continuous
                                    improvement. It is critical to have precise data before quality standards can be
                                    validated; as the old adage goes, "garbage in, trash out." As a result, every
                                    project team should undertake a complete measurement system analysis to ensure that
                                    the measuring system and data are accurate and reliable. Quality control is the
                                    final step in the project quality management process. Quality control is keeping
                                    track of the project metrics specified during the quality planning phase to verify
                                    they are operating as expected. Understanding the notion of variance as well as how
                                    to properly communicate with data are all part of quality control. Measures were
                                    defined during the quality planning stage, and quality assurance included acquiring
                                    reliable data for those metrics. In the quality control process, graphical analysis
                                    tools are used to present data so that choices about the quality of the process's
                                    output may be made quickly and simply. With this phase, it's easy to get into
                                    "analytical paralysis," so staying on course is crucial. All in all, Project Quality
                                    Management is essential to good and effective Project Management skills.</p>
