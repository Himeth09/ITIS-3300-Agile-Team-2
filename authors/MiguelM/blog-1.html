                                    Someone once said, “he who heads anywhere, arrives nowhere”. In other words, setting
                                    out to do something without a clear idea of the goal in mind ultimately amounts to
                                    nothing. No progress can be made when there is an unclear definition of what the
                                    chief end is. Planning is paramount. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines planning
                                    as “the act or process of making a plan to achieve or do something”
                                    (Merriam-Webster). In the context of Project Management and Agile, specifically, the
                                    responsibility to devise a plan and shine a light on the road ahead lies with the
                                    leader: the Scrum Master. These people are hold the authority to make decisions
                                    regarding the team and the project itself and are also expected to shoulder the
                                    responsibility of seeing the process through to the end. Furthermore, Scrum Masters
                                    are also expected to develop a plan with the organization’s specific objectives and
                                    mission in mind. Naturally, in order to make this plan a success, a strategy is
                                    needed.
                                    In the context of Project Integration Management, Strategic Planning and Project
                                    Selection both play an essential role. According to the Balanced Scorecard
                                    Institute, Strategic Planning is “an organizational management activity that is used
                                    to set priorities, focus energy and resources, strengthen operations, ensure that
                                    employees and other stakeholders are working toward common goals, establish
                                    agreement around intended outcomes/results, and assess and adjust the organization’s
                                    direction in response to a changing environment” (Balanced Scorecard Institute). In
                                    other words, planning precedes results.
                                    One of the most prominent tools for effective strategic planning is using the SWOT
                                    analysis. This tool is “a framework used to evaluate a company's competitive
                                    position and to develop strategic planning” (Kenton, 2022). SWOT incorporates four
                                    different quadrants as part of the analysis process. The four quadrants are:
                                    Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Strengths are what an organization is
                                    adept at doing and what sets it apart from its direct competition (Kenton, 2022).
                                    Most of the time, “playing to one’s strengths”, as the saying goes, is the best
                                    decision when in a competitive environment. In the case of most organizations where
                                    profit is the end goal, doing that which they know provides the most value to the
                                    customer is almost always the right way to go. Weaknesses refer to that which
                                    impedes a company from performing at the highest level it can, and that which it
                                    needs to improve in order to stay ahead of its competitors (Kenton, 2022). The
                                    saying “it’s easier to catch up than to stay ahead” carries much weight when it
                                    comes to this topic. What most organizations at the top struggle with at times is
                                    not playing to their strengths but minimizing their weaknesses, and these weaknesses
                                    create exploitable pockets which competing organizations will do their utmost to
                                    capitalize on in order to seize an advantage. Opportunities are “favorable external
                                    factors that could give an organization a competitive advantage” (Kenton, 2022).
                                    Creating opportunities is often a very difficult endeavor to undertake in most
                                    aspects of life, as opportunities often are things outside of an organization’s
                                    control. However, what an organization always has control of is its own actions and
                                    must, therefore, strive to seize and take advantage of all opportunities that fall
                                    on its lap in order to be successful. Threats refer to “factors that have the
                                    potential to harm an organization” (Kenton, 2022). Like opportunities, threats are
                                    factors most often outside of an organization’s control and are most often hard to
                                    deal with. In most cases, a strategy needs to be formed in order to deal with
                                    threats and prevent these catastrophes waiting to happen from having a negative
                                    impact on the future of an organization. Evidently, the benefits of employing SWOT
                                    analysis to create effective strategic plans cannot be understated. The quantity and
                                    quality of the information that can be obtained from using this tool constitutes,
                                    without a doubt, one of the strongest weapons when developing a successful plan.
                                    One of the most preferred ways of involving SWOT analysis in the plan devising
                                    process is to employ what is known as a mind map. A mind map is “an easy way to
                                    brainstorm thoughts organically without worrying about order and structure” (Mind
                                    Mapping). Mind maps are usually implemented as diagrams which in represent concepts
                                    in a non-linear fashion in order to build around a topic (Mind Mapping). The end
                                    goal of using SWOT analysis and Mind Mapping to inform Strategic Planning, is to
                                    then have a clear picture of what potential projects an organization should pursue
                                    in order to achieve its predefined goals. As someone once said: “perfect practice
                                    makes perfect”. It’s not enough just to plan for the sake of planning. The planning
                                    process must be intentional and well-developed with ample input from the interested
                                    parties in order to produce a game plan that will win the game. This process should
                                    not be rushed, by any means, if an organization’s goals are to be fulfilled.
                                    Some of the most overlooked and perhaps ignored components of Project Selection is
                                    often the business aspect. Every organization, barring non-profit ones, seek to make
                                    a profit. Therefore, it stands to reason that every action an organization takes has
                                    as its main goal to provide value to its customers, in order to secure a profit.
                                    Consequently, an organization’s business strategy is unequivocally crucial to its
                                    success and growth. For this reason, it is vital that Project Managers give an
                                    organization’s business strategy the place and priority it deserves.
                                    Summarizing, strategic planning and project selection are indispensable to an
                                    organization’s future and success. The careful development of plans, informed by an
                                    organization’s chosen goals, is indubitably the key to its future growth and
                                    success. It is Scrum Masters’ duty to understand the importance of the planning
                                    process, and to ensure the whole team is made keenly aware of the plan in its
                                    entirety. Similarly, it is the Project Manager’s responsibility to also inform the
                                    plan with the organization’s business strategies and goals, in order to develop a
                                    plan that turns these into reality. When these responsibilities are upheld, the plan
                                    that follows almost certainly brings about an organization’s growth and success.
