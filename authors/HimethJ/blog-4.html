                                <p class="card-text">
                                    During the project management process, it’s incredibly important to make sure that the project you are working on is completed within the budget. To do so, project managers should be developing several estimates for the costs of things like resources, reserves, and the cost of quality. Many organizations develop their estimates well in advance of the project's completion date, however, some can be even earlier to such an extent that the requirements haven’t even been solidified or, on the other hand, can be created when there’s a little less than a year before completion. But, no matter the project, the team should always attempt to develop multiple estimations over the course of the project.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Types of Cost Estimates</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Project managers usually use a couple of different types of cost estimation methods, usually varying by how long is left until project completion, the accuracy, and other various factors. The three basic types that we’ll go over are: Rough Order of Magnitude estimates, Budgetary estimates, and Definitive Estimates.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Rough Order of Magnitude</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Rough Order of Magnitude, or ROM, provide a general estimation of the overall project cost. The other name that it might be referred to as is a ballpark estimate, which should give you a clue as to what kind of estimate a ROM estimate will give you. These estimates are usually done very early in the project, sometimes even before the project has even started. Because this estimate is made at a very early stage, its accuracy is not very high. Usually, it ranges from -50% to +100%, where the final cost of the project could end up being about 50% below the ROM estimate, up to the final cost being 100% greater than the ROM. As you might expect, this method is the least accurate and definitely should not be the only cost estimate made for a project.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Budgetary</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Budgetary estimates are the middle ground in terms of accuracy between ROM estimates and definitive estimates. They are used to allocate money into an organization’s budget and are usually made about one to two years prior to the project’s completion. Budgetary estimates aren’t only the middle ground in terms of accuracy either, they’re also created somewhere in the middle of a project, usually with one to two years prior to completion. Speaking of accuracy, budgetary estimates have an accuracy of about -10% to +20%, where the final cost could end up being 10% below the estimate or 20% higher.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Definitive</h6>
                                <p>
                                    The last basic estimate we’ll talk about is definitive estimates. Definitive estimates have the highest accuracy out of all the other methods, and this comes hand in hand with being one of, if not the last, estimate made before the completion of the project. Usually developed a year or even less prior to project completion, definitive estimates are used for when accuracy is the top priority. As for their accuracy, it ranges from -5% to +10%, where the final project cost could be around 5% below the definitive estimate or 10% higher.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Check out the table below for a quick breakdown of the three basic types of cost estimations. Also, it’s important to note that while there are other types of estimates, the important factor is that a team should be using different estimates at different times and that as time passes, their estimates should become more accurate.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Tools and Techniques for Cost Estimation</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Some of the tools a project manager might use to estimate the costs of a project include, but might not be limited to, Analogous estimating, Activity-Based estimating, and Parametric estimating.
                                </p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Analogous Estimating</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Analogous estimating, also known as top-down estimating, uses the cost of a previous similar project as the base for estimating the cost for the current project. While being generally less expensive than other tools, it is less accurate and needs expert judgment to be used successfully. This is because the team that’s preparing the estimate needs to have the expertise to judge whether parts of the project will be just like the previous project, or will end up being more or less expensive. As a given of course, analogous estimating will be more reliable the more similar the previous project is to the current one.
                                </p>

                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Activity-Based Estimating</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Activity-based estimating, also known as bottom-up estimating, estimates the cost of individual activities, also known as work items, and adds them together to get the project total. As with most of these tools and techniques, the experience of the team creating the cost estimates will impact the accuracy and reliability. However, in activity-based estimating, the size of the work items also needs to be taken into account, as the smaller the work item, the higher the accuracy. The drawback of this is that using smaller work items to get higher accuracy makes activity-based estimating more time-intensive and expensive.

                                <p>
                                    Parametric estimating uses the characteristics of a project in a mathematical model to estimate the costs of a project. To increase the accuracy and reliability of this technique, a number of things must be insured. First is that the historical information from previous projects and such used to create the model has to be accurate. Next is that the parameters have to be quantifiable, as without that being so, it becomes difficult to develop accurate estimates. And lastly, parametric estimates need the model to be flexible in terms of project size, as not all projects will be on the same scale, budget, or timespan.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Typical Problems when Estimating Costs</h5>
                                <p>
                                    While many project managers and their teams understand the importance of estimating accurate costs, that doesn’t mean that no mistakes are made. Now, it's critical to remember that these aren’t the only problems that might occur when estimating costs, however, they are some of the most common.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of these mistakes is that estimates are done too quickly. Remember that developing an estimate for a project, especially a large one, is a complex process and requires a lot of planning and effort. Another mistake would be creating one or only a few estimates. If you only stick to an estimate you’ve made early into a project’s life or even before it was created, such as a ROM estimate, you could end up with a wildly inaccurate final cost at the end of the project. It’s important to create different estimates over the lifespan of the project, and not only that, you should ensure that as time passes, the estimates that are developed become more accurate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another set of problems that might occur when estimating cost has to deal with the people behind the estimations. The first is simply that they don’t have enough experience doing estimations for projects. Really the only other way to solve such an issue, other than using more experienced employees, is to provide training and mentorship so that they can learn and improve their skills. The other problem with a team is that humans just have a tendency to underestimate things and mix in their own bias into decisions. To solve this problem, just make sure that estimates are reviewed and discussed by others and not just handled by one person.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Hopefully, after reading through this blog you’ve learned a little more about estimating costs. Whether that be the basic types used, some tools and techniques, or the problems that might occur. Just remember that you shouldn’t be using only one estimate and that the more information you have about your project, the more accurate the estimates will be.
