                                    One of the most important parts of the management and the successful completion of a project is communication. Having good communication ensures that important information gets to the correct people at the appropriate time and that reports and feedback are actually useful to the improvement of the project. A lack of communication can spell disaster for a project, as it can lead to poor coordination between team members leading to significant delays and lapses in quality. I could write a whole blog on why communication is so important, but today’s blog is about improving communication, and if you really wanted to read a whole work on why communication is important, there are many other blogs and articles out there on the web that do a very good job at explaining it. And so, without much futherado, let’s get into improving project communications using the following three methods.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Developing Better Communication Skills</h5>

                                </div>
                                <p>The first way to improve project communication is a bit self explanatory, but improving your communication skills is a great way to improve communication on a project. While some people seem to be social butterflies from the get go, flexing their communication prowess with ease, others have a much harder time engaging with other people. The good thing though, is that communication is a skill that can be taught. Instead of spending more money on technical training for employees, for in an IT project, many of the employees may already have excellent technical skills, investing in communication skills training would serve to better improve the employees. However, specific skills like understanding the technical level of your audience and avoiding technical jargon aren’t the only parts of communication that team members need to be aware of. With how interconnected and global businesses are, it’s important to understand the differences of communication in different countries and cultures. While in the U.S. speaking our minds and getting straight to the point would be behaviors worth praise, that might be different in countries that prioritize politeness and sensitivity, such as Japan, where you might come off as rude. But, it’s not just up to the employees themselves to improve their communication skills, as top management should be taking appropriate measures to improve communication throughout the organization. Management should be setting expectations and actually enforcing them, making sure to not allow improper behaviors like employees giving poor presentations, writing bad reports, or even offending others from different countries and cultures to continue. Improving project communication is a team effort, and if one side isn’t performing, it ends up dragging the whole team down.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Running Effective Meetings</h5>
                                <div class="container text-center d-flex flex-column">

                                </div>
                                <p>Another action that will improve project communication is running effective meetings. A badly run meeting can have negative effects on a project, as a terrible shareholder meeting or pitch could mean the project doesn’t receive enough support or is dropped altogether. A poorly planned meeting also leads to wasting time that others could have used for more productive purposes, as I’m sure many of you have experienced before. Instead, to have a productive meeting, you should follow these guidelines:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>See if the meeting can be avoided</strong>
                                        <p>Quite self-explanatory here, if you can get the problem solved or issue addressed through an email or phone call, there’s no need to waste people’s time with an unnecessary meeting.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Outline the purpose and the outcome of the meeting</strong>
                                        <p>Make the purpose and outcome of the meeting clear to the participants. If there is no clear purpose, people generally focus on their own little agendas which derail the meeting away from its intended purpose.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Identify who exactly needs to be attending the meeting</strong>
                                        <p>Meetings are the most effective when only the minimum number of participants are involved, especially if the meeting requires decision making, and even more so if the decision being made will significantly impact either the outcome of the project or the company itself. It also ensures that other peoples’ time isn’t wasted on things that didn’t really concern them or needed their input.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Give participants an agenda or points of interest before the meeting</strong>
                                        <p>By making participants aware of the objectives for the meeting ahead of time, they can come in prepared. By being able to collect any information they might need before the meeting, the participants will be able to provide more effective input and possibly wrap up the meeting faster.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Make sure to prepare any visuals or printouts before the meeting</strong>
                                        <p>Another pretty basic step here, make sure you have any visuals on hand before the meeting, which saves time and makes it easier for participants to have a grasp on the topic being discussed.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Run the meeting in a professional manner</strong>
                                        <p>This essentially entails things like keeping track of the minutes, stating any rules that the participants have to follow, and just acting like an adult.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Using Communication Tools Effectively</h5>

                                <p>Now just because we have tools that allow us to communicate with others almost instantaneously doesn’t mean everybody is using them to communicate effectively. Even though things like e-mail and text messaging have been around for a while now, there are still people that don’t know how or when to properly use them. Out of the two, email is usually the method that a lot of people struggle with as many of us are already accustomed to texting, so here’s a couple guidelines to follow:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Send emails to the correct people, afterall, just because there might be a reply to all option doesn’t actually mean you have to use it if not necessary.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Use the subject line to properly convey what the rest of the message is about, and if the whole message can fit in the subject line, just put it there.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Make sure you’re only discussing one main subject, if you need to discuss something else, send another email with a proper subject line reflecting the new topic.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The body of an email doesn’t need to be overly complicated and formal, just keep it clear and concise and use a friendly tone.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Try reading out your email before sending it to make sure it makes sense and double check it for any spelling errors.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>However, communication tools aren’t just direct communication like emails, text messaging, and phone calls. It also involves collaborative tools like Google Docs, Kanban boards, or even wikis. If your team does end up using multiple communication tools, it’s important that each team member understands how to use each tool. As a project manager, you should do whatever you can to bring everyone up to speed on how to use the tools available to them, which will allow your team to communicate effectively and not waste time.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Conclusion</h5>
                                <p>Alright, so to wrap it all up, we discussed three different methods to improve project communication. The first being developing better communication skills, whether it be improving the employees’ skills through training or making sure that management had clear expectations that they would follow. The second method we discussed was running effective meetings. Meetings are a powerful communication tool but are often misused, resulting in a poorly structured mess that has too many participants, making them feel like it was a waste of time. If you can solve those problems, you’re on the right track. And last but not least, using communication technology effectively. Tech is rapidly evolving and it’s not easy to stay on top of it, however, you don’t need to understand every single bit. You just need to understand how to use any technology that you end up using while working on a project, and while things like email and text messaging are a must, you might end up using things like Kanban boards or collaborative workspaces like Google Drive and it’s important not to slow the project down by using these tools incorrectly.</p>
