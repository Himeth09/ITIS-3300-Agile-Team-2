                                    Risk management is an important aspect of project management and overlooking it can often lead to a negative impact on the project. It involves taking care to understand the potential problems that might happen during the project and how they can impact the project’s success. Effective risk management results in fewer problems occurring, and for those small amounts of problems, a faster and more effective way of finding a solution to them. If you’re a project manager, and especially if you are in a team using Agile methodology, this is something that you’ll want to make sure to do.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">What is Qualitative Risk Analysis?</h5>
                                <p>
                                  According to Kathy Schwalbe, the author of Information Technology Project Management, qualitative risk analysis is defined as “assessing the likelihood and impact of identified risks to determine their magnitude and priority.” Definitely a little formal, but essentially, you take a look at the risks you and your team have identified and then find out how much of an impact they're going to have on the project. On the other hand, quantitative risk analysis is a lot more thorough, using formulas, graphs, and simulations to predict the best course of action. While both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis can be done together, it really depends on the size of the project. Large and complex projects would definitely require you to be using quantitative risk analysis, but with small or relatively simple projects, only using qualitative is just fine. To actually perform qualitative risk analysis, there are two primary methods of performing qualitative risk analysis, using a Probability/Impact Matrix and using the Top Ten Risk Item Tracking technique.  
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Probability/Impact Matrix</h5>
                                <p>
                                  Project managers use a probability/impact matrix to list the probability of a risk happening and the impact that risk would cause. The first step to using this method is to determine any risks that might occur during the project. Once you have a list, identify each risk by the probability of it occurring, from high to medium to low. After finding out the probabilities of the risks, the last step is to label what kind of impact the risk might have on the project if it did occur, either high, medium, or low. An easy way of visualizing this information is to use a grid-based system like the image below. One axis outlines the probability of the risk occurring while the other axis denotes the impact that it will occur. Then you can just place each risk into the appropriate tiles.  
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Top Ten Risk Item Tracking</h5>
                                <p>
                                  The Top Ten Risk Item Tracking is another method of performing qualitative risk analysis. Just like the Probability/Impact Matrix, it also identifies the risks that might occur during the project, however, it also keeps track of the risks throughout the duration of the project by helping monitor risks. Using the Top Ten method involves performing a routine review of the project’s risks with the management. During the meeting, the participants would go over the top ten sources of risk, hence the name. This includes things like the risk’s ranking, its previous ranking -which shows if it’s been becoming more or less of a problem, the frequency of its appearance on the top ten list, and a report on any of the progress that has been made to resolving the risk.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  This review is very important as it addresses various concerns related to the project. The first is that it keeps the team and stakeholders informed of things that could reduce the chances of the project being successful. Next is that by involving various people, the team may be able to come up with more strategies to address the risks that have been identified. And lastly, it shows management that you know what you’re doing, and that you have a plan to mitigate or even resolve any of the risks that may pop up during the project’s life.  
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Risk Register</h5>
                                <p>
                                  Finally, after using either the Probability/Impact Matrix or the Top Ten Risk Item Tracking, you would then take the output of performing qualitative risk analysis and update the risk register. A risk register is often in the form of a table or spreadsheet, and it’s used for documenting any potential risks and their relevant information. So after performing either method detailed above, you would then add the risks and other pertinent information like its probability, impact, and cause.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">The Importance of Risk Management in Agile</h5>
                                <p>
                                  Because of the constant activity that might occur during an agile project, there is more uncertainty, which means in turn, more risk. To be able to continuously develop a project, a team shouldn’t be bogged down with issues arising that result in having to go back and rework things. While a good crisis management response would certainly help, not all teams will have that, and even if they did, it wouldn’t help to avoid those issues from cropping up in the first place. Being able to identify the risks that might occur and then being able to understand the impact and probabilities of them so that they can be mitigated or resolved before they become a problem is an incredibly important process that will save time and money, even more so in an Agile environment.  
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Conclusion</h5>
                                <p>
                                  So to wrap everything up, risks can quickly turn into problems if they aren’t identified and addressed in timely manner. In large and complex projects, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative risk analysis is the ideal solution, but usually only using qualitative risk analysis should be just fine. The two methods we discussed in today’s blog are Probability/Impact matrix or the Top Ten Risk Item Tracking. Both of them take the risks you and your team might have identified and the sort them in a manner so that the most likely and most impactful can be easily identified, ensuring that you don’t waste time and money attempting to fix things that aren’t as problematic as other risks. And finally, Agile projects have a lot more uncertainty than a project that would be using something like the Waterfall methodology. Therefore, it’s very important that you perform some sort of risk management to avoid wasting time and resources going back to rework things.
