                                <h5 class="mb-1">Why Collect Requirements?</h5>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Often called the most difficult step in project scope management, collecting requirements plays a very important role when planning out your project, and if not done properly can cause some major problems. Alright, sounds pretty important, but first what are requirements? Basically, all requirements are the tasks and conditions that need to be met for the project you’re working on to be successful. Ok, seems pretty straightforward, so then what do you do when collecting requirements? Well, it’s pretty much in the name, you collect and document the various requirements needed by your project, pretty self-explanatory right? Kinda, or at least it should be. As you can probably imagine, since I’m writing about this, there are a lot of people that don’t always collect requirements for their project, or maybe they just don’t do a thorough and in-depth job of it. But if a project manager doesn’t properly collect requirements, how bad can it really be?
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Consequences Of Not Collecting Requirements</h5>
                                <p>Now while many people on the project team might know some very basic project requirements for the project they’re working on, it really helps to properly identify and document the requirements as if it’s not done properly, well let’s just say you’re going to have some problems. When at the start of development, if you ever have to rework or change something about the project, it won’t cost a lot of time or resources, however, the later the development stage that this occurs in, the higher the costs. You can think of it as building a house, if the team is still drawing out the blueprint, it’s not too hard to change stuff. Move a window here, remove a wall there, etc. But if the frame of the house is already built, well it’s gonna take a lot more time and money. Check out this image from a 2017 paper by Devops Research & Assessment (DORA) below. We can see that organizations can be saving millions of dollars just by avoiding unnecessary rework and other changes to the project.</p>

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">How To Avoid Rework</h5>
                                <p>So, how do you or your organization avoid spending possibly millions of dollars on work that could have been avoided? Simply put, all it needs is planning ahead and making sure you’re taking into account everything the needs of the project and the people involved, AKA, collecting requirements. Now before you just jump into it, keep a few things in mind: How big is your project? What’s its complexity? Is it really expensive? Before you spend a lot of time collecting requirements it's important that you have an answer to those questions, as if the project is small, simple, and cheap, it wouldn’t make sense for you to spend a large amount of time collecting requirements. On the other hand, if it's the opposite and it is a really important project, well you might want to take your time. Ok, all set? Let’s get on to actually collecting the requirements for your project.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">How To Collect Requirements</h5>
                                <p>Once you’ve understood how much time you should be spending on collecting requirements, you can narrow down your options on how to actually collect them. The first set of options we’ll go over are if the project is important and you really need to be taking your time identifying requirements so that you can avoid wasting time and money on reworks and changes. </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Interviews</h5>
                                <div class="container text-center d-flex flex-column">
                                    <a href="../../images/interviews.png" class="text-center" data-lightbox="pic" data-title="Collecting Requirements">

                                    </a>
                                    <em class="enlarge-caption">Click picture to enlarge on mobile</em>
                                    <em class="image-caption">https://www.plum.io/hubfs/structured%20interview@2x.png</em>
                                </div>
                                <p>The first method of gathering requirements is to interview the people who have a vested interest in the success of the project, the stakeholders. A rather obvious one no? Interviewing stakeholders is a great way to get a majority of the requirements, and probably the most important ones too, straight from the horse’s mouth. The downside? It’s pretty time-consuming doing one-on-one interviews and could also be expensive too. However, if the project is that important, it’s probably your best bet to use this first method.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Focus Groups</h5>
                                <div class="container text-center d-flex flex-column">
                                    <a href="../../images/focus_groups.png" class="text-center" data-lightbox="pic" data-title="Collecting Requirements">
                                        <img src="../../images/focus_groups.png" class="blog-images" alt="Focus Groups">
                                    </a>
                                    <em class="enlarge-caption">Click picture to enlarge on mobile</em>
                                    <em class="image-caption">https://www.naylor.com/associationadviser/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/Focus-Groups-1-1.png</em>
                                </div>
                                <p>What if the project isn’t like do-or-die important, not that it’s not important, just not as much as some others might be. Well, this second method has got you covered. If it’s too expensive and time-consuming to interview people one by one, just gather a whole bunch of them and interview them all together! Also known as focus groups or workshops, these are great ways to gather requirements as well as people’s opinions about the project, all while being cheaper and faster than interviewing. Now, these next few methods aren’t bad at all, it's just that if you could only do one of these methods for an important project, you should really either go for interviews or focus groups.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Surveys/Questionnaires</h5>
                                <div class="container text-center d-flex flex-column">
                                    <a href="../../images/surveys.jpg" class="text-center" data-lightbox="pic" data-title="Collecting Requirements">
                                        <img src="../../images/surveys.jpg" class="blog-images" alt="Surveys">
                                    </a>
                                    <em class="enlarge-caption">Click picture to enlarge on mobile</em>
                                    <em class="image-caption">https://a1surveys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/b-768x424.jpg</em>
                                </div>
                                <p>But enough of that, the third method that you have to collect requirements are surveys and/or questionnaires. Incredibly easy to make and distribute, not to mention really cheap, these can be a great way of collecting information about the project from a large number of people very quickly. This efficiency is really amazing, but only if the participants provide honest and thorough information. How many times, after getting a link to a customer satisfaction survey on a receipt at a store or something, have you actually seriously answered? I’m willing to bet that a lot of you just put in some random answers, and that’s if you even took the survey. And that’s why this shouldn’t be used as your primary method of gathering requirements for important projects. The risk that you’ll get some false data or just a general lack of participation is too high to justify.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Prototyping/Document Analysis</h5>
                                <div class="container text-center d-flex flex-column">
                                    <a href="../../images/prototyping.jpg" class="text-center" data-lightbox="pic" data-title="Collecting Requirements">
                                        <img src="../../images/prototyping.jpg" class="blog-images" alt="Prototyping">
                                    </a>

                                </div>
                                <p>The last requirement collection method I want to talk to you about is actually a collection of some methods, specifically: prototyping and document analysis. Prototyping itself is pretty self-explanatory, you make a smaller, less expensive version of your project and see if you can find out anything that you might have missed in the design stage. But how about document analysis? Well when you first start setting up a project, there’s usually quite a bit of paperwork that needs to be done. Stuff like the project charter and the project management plan usually have many of the requirements already listed out, and so, you can just use those. Of course, you shouldn’t just only rely on those documents and the same really goes for all of these methods of gathering requirements.</p>
                                <h5>In Conclusion</h5>
                                <p>You shouldn’t really rely on only one method of collecting requirements. It really works the best when you mix and match these different methods to suit you, the company, and the project you’re working on. And so, at the end of this blog, I hope you have a pretty decent idea of how important it is to collect requirements and some ways to get started on doing just that.</p>
