                                    Planning procurement management consists of deciding whether or not to procure, what to procure in the first place, how to procure, how much to procure, and also when to procure. And then once the planning is finished, it outputs a make-or-buy decision. To plan procurement management, several documents and inputs are required, such as a project charter, a project management plan, and organizational process assets like the thing we are talking about today, contracts.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Contracts</h5>
                                <p>
                                  We have three categories of contracts to talk about today, fixed-price/lump-sum, cost reimbursable, and time and material. Each type of contract can be used in different situations, though one contract can actually include all 3 categories of contracts. As a project manager, you will need to understand the basics behind each type and to know when to use each category.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Fixed-Price/Lump-Sum</h5>
                                <p>
                                  The first category is fixed-price or lump-sum contracts. These have a fixed total price, hence the name fixed-price, and since the price is already established, the buyer incurs very little risk. The seller is also able to slightly increase the estimated cost to reduce their own risk, however, the amount is generally minimal as the price will have to stay competitive. Fixed-price contracts can also add incentives as a reward for meeting or exceeding certain objectives that have been set. The absolute lowest risk version of this category would be a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract which is then followed by a fixed-price incentive fee (FPIF) contract and then finally the fixed-price with economic price adjustment (FP–EPA) contract.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Cost-Reimbursable</h5>
                                <p>
                                  Cost-reimbursable contracts differ greatly from the previous category, as they revolve around payments made to the supplier for direct and indirect actual costs. However, if you remember, indirect actual costs aren’t able to be traced back in a cost-effective way, so instead, we need to calculate them based on a percentage of the direct costs. Cost-reimbursable contracts also have fees like profit percentage or incentives, like the fixed-price contract, for meeting or exceeding goals, but unlike the fixed-price contract, the buyer takes on more risk here. There are three types of cost-reimbursable contracts that go in order of least to highest risk to the buyer. The lowest risk is a cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) contract, where the buyer has to pay the supplier for costs in addition to a fee and incentive. The next is the cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract, where much like the CPIF contract, the buyer has to pay the supplier for allowable costs, but instead the fixed fee is based on a percentage of the estimated costs.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Time and Material (T&M)</h5>
                                <p>
                                  The last type of contract is a mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Since it is a hybrid of the two other contracts, it uses both a fixed price and fees based on direct and indirect costs. This kind of contract is usually used whenever the total costs aren’t able to be estimated or if the work can’t be specified clearly. Because time and material contracts are so flexible, the risk is also variable, either being low or high risk depending on the project and other parts of the contract.

                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Why Does This Matter And What Does This Have To Do With Agile?</h5>
                                <p>
                                  Contracts are essentially the best kind of written promise that you can have, as it’s an agreement between the parties to provide certain goods and services for a certain price. Making a contract is an essential part of planning procurement management, and without it, you wouldn’t be able to reach a make-or-buy decision. Procurement management also involves sharing risks between the buyer and seller, which a contract helps in as it is essentially a written agreement between the participants. In an agile environment, without having a good plan for procurement management, it wouldn’t be very hard to start going over the budget anytime changes or any last minute additions have to be made. On top of that, an agile environment or project is volatile and always changing, so being able to share the risk between the buyer and seller is incredibly important to making sure that the project succeeds. I hope that this blog has shown how important contracts are, whether you are in an agile environment or not, and I’ll see you next week!
