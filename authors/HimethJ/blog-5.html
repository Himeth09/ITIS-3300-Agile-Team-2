                                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted text-center"><em>March 15, 2022</em></h6>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    When you think about improving the quality of a project, any project, not just an IT one, many people would immediately think about practices like quality control, planning, and quality assurance. However, there are many other solutions that don’t immediately come to mind. In today’s blog, we’ll be discussing these underrated solutions, from their importance to project quality to how to successfully implement them in your project.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Leadership</h5>
                                <p>The first solution to improving the quality of your project might surprise you as it isn’t about the project team that’s directly working on the project. Instead, it’s the leadership of the top/upper management of an organization. If we go on a little tangent here, an organization remains competitive because they offer good quality programs, products, and/or services. Well, to create and successfully implement these offerings, organizations need top management to lead the way. They need to take responsibility for the creation, implementation, promotion, and the support after the release of the organization’s offerings. Strong and well-integrated leadership creates an environment inside of the organization that is conducive to producing and improving the quality of their products and services. Company philosophy, their commitment to quality, and training and measurement programs are all declared by the top management. When every employee at an organization insists on producing high-quality goods and services, that’s how you know that the top management at your organization has done a good job.</p>
                                <p>An excellent example of this is the philosophy of Kaizen that is used by Toyota. Kaizen is a Japanese philosophy that promotes change for the better. The idea is that it is always better to change something to make it better even if it slows down the process. Toyota implements this by allowing any employee at any level of the manufacturing process to stop production if they can spot an improvement that can be made or a problem that is occurring in the assembly. The top management of Toyota successfully implemented this philosophy for years, and by actively encouraging their employees to raise concerns wherever they see them, Toyota has found that many problems with assembly are caught long before the car goes to market. When given encouragement to raise their concerns about any problems they noticed, the employees actually spoke up, who would have thought?</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Cost of Quality</h5>
                                <p>The second overlooked solution is understanding the cost of quality. To calculate the cost of quality, you simply add the cost of conformance to the cost of nonconformance. Super self-explanatory right? Not! Let’s break it down a bit. The first part, conformance, is just making sure that you are delivering products/services that meet the requirements and the fitness for use. Nonconformance is basically taking responsibility for any failures or if the product/service doesn’t meet the quality expectations that were identified. Now, there are five major cost categories related to the quality of a project, they are: Prevention, Appraisal, Internal Failure, External Failure, and Measurement and Test Equipment.</p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Prevention Cost</h6>
                                <p>Prevention cost is the cost that arises from the planning and execution of a project to ensure that it is error-free or within an acceptable error range that has been specified. It’s a very important cost to factor in, as the sooner you can detect any kind of defects or problems with a project, the cheaper it is to solve than if it was caught in a later development phase. One of the biggest losses ever was during the issue of Y2K, as many companies had decided to use a two-character format for the date, like say using 71 for 1971. However, when the new millennium was almost upon us, those same companies had to rework their systems to use four characters for the date, which ended up costing billions of dollars. Yeah, billions, with a capital B.</p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Appraisal Cost</h6>
                                <p>Appraisal cost is like Prevention cost, only instead of focusing on the project overall, appraisal cost focuses on processes and their outputs and making sure that they fall into that acceptable error range or is error-free. Activities such as inspecting and testing products, processing and reporting on any information gained from the inspection and testing, as well as the maintaining of those inspection and testing equipment all fall under the appraisal cost category.</p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Internal Failure Cost</h6>
                                <p>The next cost category is internal failure. As you might expect from the name, it’s the cost incurred by fixing a problem or defect that was identified before the product was delivered to the customer, or as the name hints, internally. Things like scrap and rework, costs related to late payments of bills, inventory costs that were incurred by the defects of the product, correcting documentation, and the cost of labor to correct the design error all fall under internal failure costs.</p>
                                <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">External Failure Cost</h6>
                                <p>External failure costs are a lot like internal failure costs, just instead of catching the problem/defect before the product is delivered to the customer, it’s instead caught after. Items such as warranties, handling customer complaints, and future losses due to recalls, reimbursements, or a loss of trust by consumers are all associated with external failure costs.</p>
                                <h6>Measurement and Test Equipment Cost</h6>
                                <p>The last cost category is measurement and test equipment costs. This one is pretty self-explanatory, as it’s just the cost of any of the equipment used to find problems and defects in the project as well as any other appraisal activities that might occur during the project’s life.</p>
                                <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Managing Expectations and Conclusion</h5>
                                <p>By identifying these categories in your project, you have a much better chance of identifying the cost of quality and how much it will be just to make sure that you are delivering on the expectations that have been set out by top management and other stakeholders. Speaking of expectations, let me wrap this blog post up by talking about managing them and recognizing the differences of expectations in different cultures and people is another overlooked solution. While a lot of aspects of quality can be clearly defined and measured through different methods and techniques, there are also many other aspects that can’t be, so don’t just proceed with the project assuming the only expectations you have to meet are the ones that have been currently outlined. In addition to that, don’t forget that other countries and cultures can have different quality expectations as well. Well that’s all that I have for you today, I hope that after reading this post, you’ve gotten some good ideas on how to improve the quality of your next project.</p>
