                                    <h5 class="mb-1">What Is A Project Charter?</h5>
                                        A project charter is, according to this excerpt from the text Information Technology Project Management, “a document that formally recognizes the existence of a project and provides direction on the project’s objectives and management.” Essentially, it lets those in the organization know the who, what, when, where, and why of the projects that top management have chosen to pursue. It also gives formal authorization for the formation of the project team and for the project to move forward with planning. While they might sound a little complicated, project charters aren’t difficult to write and having one to refer back to throughout the project lifecycle, which may happen frequently in an Agile workspace, makes managing the project much easier. It is one of the crucial first steps in the project management lifecycle and having a strong project charter can lay the foundation for a successful project.
                                    <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Why Make A Project Charter?</h5>
                                        As a project manager, a project charter is an essential document to inform the rest of the organization about which projects they are working on. What’s more, a lot of projects fail because of unclear requirements, unreasonable expectations, and a lack of promised support. Basically, without clear documentation, the management of a project becomes disorganized as no one knows who should be responsible for what, how much support they should receive from this team, etcetera. While it may be obvious that a project charter is very valuable to a team in helping them stay on track with the project’s scope, there has to be a reason why some project teams don’t use it, right?
                                        Well, it all comes down to speed and efficiency. Agile is all about that turnaround time and constant releases, so having a document with a lot of legal mumbo jumbo, large amounts of other extraneous information, and other clutter can make it a very compelling process to skip. But, not all project charters are like that, in fact, they really shouldn’t be. While all that information mentioned earlier is important, it’s not really that essential for the team executing the project. If we look back at the definition we have of a project charter, all it needs to do is describe the details of a project to others in the organization, so ideally, the charter would only be a page or two in length. It would only need relevant details like who’s in charge, how much funding they need, the start and end dates, along with signatures from stakeholders and people in charge of the project as they should also be included in the creation of the charter.
                                    <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Making A Project Charter</h5>
                                        Even though creating a project charter sounds complicated with its many requirements, it’s actually not as difficult as it might seem. As was stated above, if you make sure to keep the unnecessary information out of the document and keep it short and to the point, the process to create a project charter should be fairly straightforward. The real challenge is gathering people with the proper knowledge and authority to write and sign a project charter. They shouldn’t all be from one field or level, as multiple perspectives from various people are an important step in developing an accurate project charter. Once you’ve identified the people you need to help create the charter, you can break down the information needed for a project charter into a couple of sections.
                                        <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Project Information</h6>
                                            A project charter’s primary job is to inform people in an organization about the basics of a project, therefore, the first section should include general information about the project. Information like the project’s title, the project manager and their contact information, a summary of the schedule including the planned start and end dates, and a brief description of the project’s objectives. Other basic information that you should probably include in this section is a summary of the project’s budget, the project’s success criteria, and its date of authorization.
                                        <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Roles And Responsibilities</h6>
                                            After the project information, the next step is to identify the members of the project team and their roles and responsibilities. And not just the team members either, you should identify the stakeholders as well as their needs and expectations since as a manager, you will be responsible for reporting to them and managing their expectations. A couple of ways you can do this is with a roles and responsibilities matrix or with an org chart.
                                        <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Business Case And Benefits Management Plan</h6>
                                            These two items are incredibly important, not only for a project charter but for any investment made by an organization. The business case depicts the reasons why the organization is even doing the project in the first place as well as the expected benefits, when they will reach them, and other high-level requirements. The benefits management plan ties into the business case by expanding on how and when the benefits will be achieved and managed. Various topics can be included in this plan, such as the timeframe for realizing benefits, assumptions and risks, and the return on investment for project stakeholders.
                                        <h6 class="mb-1 mt-3">Comments And Sign-Off</h6>
                                            The last thing that should be included in a project charter is a section for any additional comments that the stakeholders might have and a place for those stakeholders to sign their agreement with the details of the project charter. A written agreement is paramount in many facets of business, and with this section for signatures, it provides a form of accountability to the people who participated in the creation of the project charter.
                                    <h5 class="mb-1 mt-3">Example Of A Project Charter</h5>
                                        Here below we have an example of a project charter from the textbook Information Technology Management 9th edition by Kathy Schwalbe. As you can see, the example project charter isn’t very lengthy, and really it should only take a day at most for most projects to write up their own project charters. By keeping it short and straightforward, it’s easy for the project team to refer back to and find the information that they’re looking for.
